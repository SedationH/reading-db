      <p>O<span class="RunIn">N THE FINAL </span>day of my sophomore year of
        high school, I was hit in the face with a baseball bat. As my classmate
        took a full swing, the bat slipped out of his hands and came flying
        toward me before striking me directly between the eyes. I have no memory
        of the moment of impact.</p>
      <p>The bat smashed into my face with such force that it crushed my nose
        into a distorted U-shape. The collision sent the soft tissue of my brain
        slamming into the inside of my skull. Immediately, a wave of swelling
        surged throughout my head. In a fraction of a second, I had a broken
        nose, multiple skull fractures, and two shattered eye sockets.</p>
      <p>When I opened my eyes, I saw people staring at me and running over to
        help. I looked down and noticed spots of red on my clothes. One of my
        classmates took the shirt off his back and handed it to me. I used it to
        plug the stream of blood rushing from my broken nose. Shocked and
        confused, I was unaware of how seriously I had been injured.</p>
      <p>My teacher looped his arm around my shoulder and we began the long
        walk to the nurse’s office: across the field, down the hill, and back
        <span id="06_Introduction_My_Story.xhtml#page_2" class="pagebreak" title="2"></span>into school. Random hands
        touched my sides, holding me
        upright. We took our time and walked slowly. Nobody realized that every
        minute mattered.
      </p>
      <p>When we arrived at the nurse’s office, she asked me a series of
        questions.</p>
      <p>“What year is it?”</p>
      <p>“1998,” I answered. It was actually 2002.</p>
      <p>“Who is the president of the United States?”</p>
      <p>“Bill Clinton,” I said. The correct answer was George W. Bush.</p>
      <p>“What is your mom’s name?”</p>
      <p>“Uh. Um.” I stalled. Ten seconds passed.</p>
      <p>“Patti,” I said casually, ignoring the fact that it had taken me ten
        seconds to remember my own mother’s name.</p>
      <p>That is the last question I remember. My body was unable to handle
        the rapid swelling in my brain and I lost consciousness before the
        ambulance arrived. Minutes later, I was carried out of school and taken
        to the local hospital.</p>
      <p>Shortly after arriving, my body began shutting down. I struggled with
        basic functions like swallowing and breathing. I had my first seizure of
        the day. Then I stopped breathing entirely. As the doctors hurried to
        supply me with oxygen, they also decided the local hospital was
        unequipped to handle the situation and ordered a helicopter to fly me to
        a larger hospital in Cincinnati.</p>
      <p>I was rolled out of the emergency room doors and toward the helipad
        across the street. The stretcher rattled on a bumpy sidewalk as one
        nurse pushed me along while another pumped each breath into me by hand.
        My mother, who had arrived at the hospital a few moments before, climbed
        into the helicopter beside me. I remained unconscious and unable to
        breathe on my own as she held my hand during the flight.</p>
      <p><span id="06_Introduction_My_Story.xhtml#page_3" class="pagebreak" title="3"></span>While my mother rode with
        me in the helicopter, my
        father went home to check on my brother and sister and break the news to
        them. He choked back tears as he explained to my sister that he would
        miss her eighth-grade graduation ceremony that night. After passing my
        siblings off to family and friends, he drove to Cincinnati to meet my
        mother.</p>
      <p>When my mom and I landed on the roof of the hospital, a team of
        nearly twenty doctors and nurses sprinted onto the helipad and wheeled
        me into the trauma unit. By this time, the swelling in my brain had
        become so severe that I was having repeated post-traumatic seizures. My
        broken bones needed to be fixed, but I was in no condition to undergo
        surgery. After yet another seizure—my third of the day—I was put into a
        medically induced coma and placed on a ventilator.</p>
      <p>My parents were no strangers to this hospital. Ten years earlier,
        they had entered the same building on the ground floor after my sister
        was diagnosed with leukemia at age three. I was five at the time. My
        brother was just six months old. After two and a half years of
        chemotherapy treatments, spinal taps, and bone marrow biopsies, my
        little sister finally walked out of the hospital happy, healthy, and
        cancer free. And now, after ten years of normal life, my parents found
        themselves back in the same place with a different child.</p>
      <p>While I slipped into a coma, the hospital sent a priest and a social
        worker to comfort my parents. It was the same priest who had met with
        them a decade earlier on the evening they found out my sister had
        cancer.</p>
      <p>As day faded into night, a series of machines kept me alive. My
        parents slept restlessly on a hospital mattress—one moment they would
        collapse from fatigue, the next they would be wide awake with worry. My
        mother would tell me later, “It was one of the worst nights I’ve ever
        had.”</p>
      <h3 class="x05-Head-A"><span id="06_Introduction_My_Story.xhtml#page_4" class="pagebreak" title="4"></span>MY
        RECOVERY</h3>
      <p>Mercifully, by the next morning my breathing had rebounded to the
        point where the doctors felt comfortable releasing me from the coma.
        When I finally regained consciousness, I discovered that I had lost my
        ability to smell. As a test, a nurse asked me to blow my nose and sniff
        an apple juice box. My sense of smell returned, but—to everyone’s
        surprise—the act of blowing my nose forced air through the fractures in
        my eye socket and pushed my left eye outward. My eyeball bulged out of
        the socket, held precariously in place by my eyelid and the optic nerve
        attaching my eye to my brain.</p>
      <p>The ophthalmologist said my eye would gradually slide back into place
        as the air seeped out, but it was hard to tell how long this would take.
        I was scheduled for surgery one week later, which would allow me some
        additional time to heal. I looked like I had been on the wrong end of a
        boxing match, but I was cleared to leave the hospital. I returned home
        with a broken nose, half a dozen facial fractures, and a bulging left
        eye.</p>
      <p>The following months were hard. It felt like everything in my life
        was on pause. I had double vision for weeks; I literally couldn’t see
        straight. It took more than a month, but my eyeball did eventually
        return to its normal location. Between the seizures and my vision
        problems, it was eight months before I could drive a car again. At
        physical therapy, I practiced basic motor patterns like walking in a
        straight line. I was determined not to let my injury get me down, but
        there were more than a few moments when I felt depressed and
        overwhelmed.</p>
      <p>I became painfully aware of how far I had to go when I returned to
        the baseball field one year later. Baseball had always been a major part
        of my life. My dad had played minor league baseball for the St. Louis
        Cardinals, and I had a dream of playing professionally, too. After <span
          id="06_Introduction_My_Story.xhtml#page_5" class="pagebreak" title="5"></span>months of rehabilitation, what I
        wanted more than
        anything was to get back on the field.</p>
      <p>But my return to baseball was not smooth. When the season rolled
        around, I was the only junior to be cut from the varsity baseball team.
        I was sent down to play with the sophomores on junior varsity. I had
        been playing since age four, and for someone who had spent so much time
        and effort on the sport, getting cut was humiliating. I vividly remember
        the day it happened. I sat in my car and cried as I flipped through the
        radio, desperately searching for a song that would make me feel
        better.</p>
      <p>After a year of self-doubt, I managed to make the varsity team as a
        senior, but I rarely made it on the field. In total, I played eleven
        innings of high school varsity baseball, barely more than a single
        game.</p>
      <p>Despite my lackluster high school career, I still believed I could
        become a great player. And I knew that if things were going to improve,
        I was the one responsible for making it happen. The turning point came
        two years after my injury, when I began college at Denison University.
        It was a new beginning, and it was the place where I would discover the
        surprising power of small habits for the first time.</p>
      <h3 class="x05-Head-A">HOW I LEARNED ABOUT HABITS</h3>
      <p>Attending Denison was one of the best decisions of my life. I earned
        a spot on the baseball team and, although I was at the bottom of the
        roster as a freshman, I was thrilled. Despite the chaos of my high
        school years, I had managed to become a college athlete.</p>
      <p>I wasn’t going to be starting on the baseball team anytime soon, so I
        focused on getting my life in order. While my peers stayed up late and
        played video games, I built good sleep habits and went to bed early each
        night. In the messy world of a college dorm, I made a point to <span id="06_Introduction_My_Story.xhtml#page_6"
          class="pagebreak" title="6"></span>keep my room neat and tidy. These improvements were
        minor, but they gave me a sense of control over my life. I started to
        feel confident again. And this growing belief in myself rippled into the
        classroom as I improved my study habits and managed to earn straight A’s
        during my first year.</p>
      <p>A habit is a routine or behavior that is performed regularly—and, in
        many cases, automatically. As each semester passed, I accumulated small
        but consistent habits that ultimately led to results that were
        unimaginable to me when I started. For example, for the first time in my
        life, I made it a habit to lift weights multiple times per week, and in
        the years that followed, my six-foot-four-inch frame bulked up from a
        featherweight 170 to a lean 200 pounds.</p>
      <p>When my sophomore season arrived, I earned a starting role on the
        pitching staff. By my junior year, I was voted team captain and at the
        end of the season, I was selected for the all-conference team. But it
        was not until my senior season that my sleep habits, study habits, and
        strength-training habits really began to pay off.</p>
      <p>Six years after I had been hit in the face with a baseball bat, flown
        to the hospital, and placed into a coma, I was selected as the top male
        athlete at Denison University and named to the ESPN Academic All-America
        Team—an honor given to just thirty-three players across the country. By
        the time I graduated, I was listed in the school record books in eight
        different categories. That same year, I was awarded the university’s
        highest academic honor, the President’s Medal.</p>
      <p>I hope you’ll forgive me if this sounds boastful. To be honest, there
        was nothing legendary or historic about my athletic career. I never
        ended up playing professionally. However, looking back on those years, I
        believe I accomplished something just as rare: I fulfilled my potential.
        And I believe the concepts in this book can help you fulfill your
        potential as well.</p>
      <p>We all face challenges in life. This injury was one of mine, and the
        <span id="06_Introduction_My_Story.xhtml#page_7" class="pagebreak" title="7"></span>experience taught me a
        critical lesson: changes that
        seem small and unimportant at first will compound into remarkable
        results if you’re willing to stick with them for years. <span
          id="06_Introduction_My_Story.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText0"></span>We all
        deal with setbacks but in the long run, the quality of our lives often
        depends on the quality of our habits. With the same habits, you’ll end
        up with the same results. But with better habits, anything is
        possible.

      <p>Maybe there are people who can achieve incredible success overnight.
        I don’t know any of them, and I’m certainly not one of them. There
        wasn’t one defining moment on my journey from medically induced coma to
        Academic All-American; there were many. It was a gradual evolution, a
        long series of small wins and tiny breakthroughs. The only way I made
        progress—the only choice I had—was to start small. And I employed this
        same strategy a few years later when I started my own business and began
        working on this book.</p>
      <h3 class="x05-Head-A">HOW AND WHY I WROTE THIS BOOK</h3>
      <p>In November 2012, I began publishing articles at jamesclear.com. For
        years, I had been keeping notes about my personal experiments with
        habits and I was finally ready to share some of them publicly. I began
        by publishing a new article every Monday and Thursday. Within a few
        months, this simple writing habit led to my first one thousand email
        subscribers, and by the end of 2013 that number had grown to more than
        thirty thousand people.</p>
      <p>In 2014, my email list expanded to over one hundred thousand
        subscribers, which made it one of the fastest-growing newsletters on the
        internet. I had felt like an impostor when I began writing two years
        earlier, but now I was becoming known as an expert on habits—a new label
        that excited me but also felt uncomfortable. I had never considered
        myself a master of the topic, but rather someone who was experimenting
        alongside my readers.</p>
      <p><span id="06_Introduction_My_Story.xhtml#page_8" class="pagebreak" title="8"></span>In 2015, I reached two
        hundred thousand email
        subscribers and signed a book deal with Penguin Random House to begin
        writing the book you are reading now. As my audience grew, so did my
        business opportunities. I was increasingly asked to speak at top
        companies about the science of habit formation, behavior change, and
        continuous improvement. I found myself delivering keynote speeches at
        conferences in the United States and Europe.</p>
      <p>In 2016, my articles began to appear regularly in major publications
        like <em>Time</em>, <em>Entrepreneur</em>, and <em>Forbes</em>.
        Incredibly, my writing was read by over eight million people that year.
        Coaches in the NFL, NBA, and MLB began reading my work and sharing it
        with their teams.</p>
      <p>At the start of 2017, I launched the Habits Academy, which became the
        premier training platform for organizations and individuals interested
        in building better habits in life and work.<span id="06_Introduction_My_Story.xhtml#footnote-000-backlink"><a
            href="42_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_1" class="_idFootnoteLink noteref" role="doc-noteref">*</a></span> Fortune
        500 companies and growing
        start-ups began to enroll their leaders and train their staff. In total,
        over ten thousand leaders, managers, coaches, and teachers have
        graduated from the Habits Academy, and my work with them has taught me
        an incredible amount about what it takes to make habits work in the real
        world.</p>
      <p>As I put the finishing touches on this book in 2018, jamesclear.com
        is receiving millions of visitors per month and nearly five hundred
        thousand people subscribe to my weekly email newsletter—a number that is
        so far beyond my expectations when I began that I’m not even sure what
        to think of it.</p>
      <h3 class="x05-Head-A">HOW THIS BOOK WILL BENEFIT YOU</h3>
      <p><span id="06_Introduction_My_Story.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText1"></span>The
        entrepreneur and investor Naval Ravikant has said, “To write a great
        book, you must first become the book.” I originally learned about <span
          id="06_Introduction_My_Story.xhtml#page_9" class="pagebreak" title="9"></span>the ideas mentioned here because
        I had to live them. I
        had to rely on small habits to rebound from my injury, to get stronger
        in the gym, to perform at a high level on the field, to become a writer,
        to build a successful business, and simply to develop into a responsible
        adult. Small habits helped me fulfill my potential, and since you picked
        up this book, I’m guessing you’d like to fulfill yours as well.</p>
      <p>In the pages that follow, I will share a step-by-step plan for
        building better habits—not for days or weeks, but for a lifetime. While
        science supports everything I’ve written, this book is not an academic
        research paper; it’s an operating manual. You’ll find wisdom and
        practical advice front and center as I explain the science of how to
        create and change your habits in a way that is easy to understand and
        apply.</p>
      <p>The fields I draw on—biology, neuroscience, philosophy, psychology,
        and more—have been around for many years. What I offer you is a
        synthesis of the best ideas smart people figured out a long time ago as
        well as the most compelling discoveries scientists have made recently.
        My contribution, I hope, is to find the ideas that matter most and
        connect them in a way that is highly actionable. Anything wise in these
        pages you should credit to the many experts who preceded me. Anything
        foolish, assume it is my error.</p>
      <p>The backbone of this book is my four-step model of habits—cue,
        craving, response, and reward—and the four laws of behavior change that
        evolve out of these steps. Readers with a psychology background may
        recognize some of these terms from operant conditioning, which was first
        proposed as “<span id="06_Introduction_My_Story.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText2"></span>stimulus,
        response, reward” by B. F. Skinner in the 1930s and has been popularized
        more recently as “<span id="06_Introduction_My_Story.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText3"></span>cue,
        routine, reward” in <em>The Power of Habit</em> by Charles Duhigg.</p>
      <p>Behavioral scientists like Skinner realized that if you offered the
        right reward or punishment, you could get people to act in a certain
        way. But while Skinner’s model did an excellent job of explaining how
        external stimuli influenced our habits, it lacked a good explanation
        <span id="06_Introduction_My_Story.xhtml#page_10" class="pagebreak" title="10"></span>for how our thoughts,
        feelings, and beliefs impact our
        behavior. Internal states—our moods and emotions—matter, too. In recent
        decades, scientists have begun to determine the connection between our
        thoughts, feelings, and behavior. This research will also be covered in
        these pages.
      </p>
      <p>In total, the framework I offer is an integrated model of the
        cognitive and behavioral sciences. I believe it is one of the first
        models of human behavior to accurately account for both the influence of
        external stimuli and internal emotions on our habits. While some of the
        language may be familiar, I am confident that the details—and the
        applications of the Four Laws of Behavior Change—will offer a new way to
        think about your habits.</p>
      <p>Human behavior is always changing: situation to situation, moment to
        moment, second to second. But this book is about what <em>doesn’t</em>
        change. It’s about the fundamentals of human behavior. The lasting
        principles you can rely on year after year. The ideas you can build a
        business around, build a family around, build a life around.</p>
      <p>There is no one right way to create better habits, but this book
        describes the best way I know—an approach that will be effective
        regardless of where you start or what you’re trying to change. The
        strategies I cover will be relevant to anyone looking for a step-by-step
        system for improvement, whether your goals center on health, money,
        productivity, relationships, or all of the above. As long as human
        behavior is involved, this book will be your guide.</p>

        </span>British Cycling changed one day in 2003. The organization, which
        was the governing body for professional cycling in Great Britain, had
        recently hired Dave Brailsford as its new performance director. At the
        time, professional cyclists in Great Britain had endured nearly one
        hundred years of mediocrity. Since 1908, British riders had won <span
          id="08_1_The_Surprising_Powe.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText4"></span>just a
        single gold medal at the Olympic Games, and they had fared even worse in
        cycling’s biggest race, <span id="08_1_The_Surprising_Powe.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText5"></span>the Tour
        de France. In 110 years, no British cyclist had ever won the event.</p>
      <p>In fact, the performance of British riders had been so underwhelming
        that <span id="08_1_The_Surprising_Powe.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText6"></span>one of
        the top bike manufacturers in Europe refused to sell bikes to the team
        because they were afraid that it would hurt sales if other professionals
        saw the Brits using their gear.</p>
      <p>Brailsford had been hired to put British Cycling on a new trajectory.
        What made him different from previous coaches was his relentless
        commitment to a strategy that he referred to as “the aggregation of
        marginal gains,” which was the philosophy of searching for a tiny margin
        of improvement in everything you do. Brailsford said, “<span
          id="08_1_The_Surprising_Powe.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText7"></span>The
        whole principle came from the idea that if you broke down everything you
        <span id="08_1_The_Surprising_Powe.xhtml#page_14" class="pagebreak" title="14"></span>could think of that goes
        into riding a bike, and then
        improve it by 1 percent, you will get a significant increase when you
        put them all together.”
      </p>
      <p><span id="08_1_The_Surprising_Powe.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText8"></span>Brailsford
        and his coaches began by making small adjustments you might expect from
        a professional cycling team. They redesigned the bike seats to make them
        more comfortable and rubbed alcohol on the tires for a better grip. They
        asked riders to wear electrically heated overshorts to maintain ideal
        muscle temperature while riding and used biofeedback sensors to monitor
        how each athlete responded to a particular workout. The team tested
        various fabrics in a wind tunnel and had their outdoor riders switch to
        indoor racing suits, which proved to be lighter and more
        aerodynamic.</p>
      <p>But they didn’t stop there. Brailsford and his team continued to find
        1 percent improvements in overlooked and unexpected areas. They tested
        different types of massage gels to see which one led to the fastest
        muscle recovery. They hired a surgeon to teach each rider the best way
        to wash their hands to reduce the chances of catching a cold. They
        determined the type of pillow and mattress that led to the best night’s
        sleep for each rider. <span id="08_1_The_Surprising_Powe.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText9"></span>They
        even painted the inside of the team truck white, which helped them spot
        little bits of dust that would normally slip by unnoticed but could
        degrade the performance of the finely tuned bikes.</p>
      <p>As these and hundreds of other small improvements accumulated, the
        results came faster than anyone could have imagined.</p>
      <p><span id="08_1_The_Surprising_Powe.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText10"></span>Just
        five years after Brailsford took over, the British Cycling team
        dominated the road and track cycling events at the 2008 Olympic Games in
        Beijing, where they won an astounding 60 percent of the gold medals
        available. Four years later, when the Olympic Games came to London,
        <span id="08_1_The_Surprising_Powe.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText11"></span>the
        Brits raised the bar as they set nine Olympic records and seven world
        records.
      </p>
      <p>That same year, <span id="08_1_The_Surprising_Powe.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText12"></span>Bradley
        Wiggins became the first British cyclist to win the Tour de France. The
        next year, his teammate <span id="08_1_The_Surprising_Powe.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText13"></span>Chris
        Froome won the race, and he would go on to win again in 2015, 2016, and
        2017, giving the British team five Tour de France victories in six
        years.</p>
      <p><span id="08_1_The_Surprising_Powe.xhtml#page_15" class="pagebreak" title="15"></span><span
          id="08_1_The_Surprising_Powe.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText14"></span>During
        the ten-year span from 2007 to 2017, British cyclists won 178 world
        championships and sixty-six Olympic or Paralympic gold medals and
        captured five Tour de France victories in what is widely regarded as the
        most successful run in cycling history.<span id="08_1_The_Surprising_Powe.xhtml#footnote-002-backlink"><a
            href="43_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_1" class="_idFootnoteLink noteref" role="doc-noteref">*</a></span></p>
      <p>How does this happen? How does a team of previously ordinary athletes
        transform into world champions with tiny changes that, at first glance,
        would seem to make a modest difference at best? Why do small
        improvements accumulate into such remarkable results, and how can you
        replicate this approach in your own life?</p>
      <h3 class="x05-Head-A">WHY SMALL HABITS MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE</h3>
      <p>It is so easy to overestimate the importance of one defining moment
        and underestimate the value of making small improvements on a daily
        basis. Too often, we convince ourselves that massive success requires
        massive action. Whether it is losing weight, building a business,
        writing a book, winning a championship, or achieving any other goal, we
        put pressure on ourselves to make some earth-shattering improvement that
        everyone will talk about.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, improving by 1 percent isn’t particularly
        notable—sometimes it isn’t even <em>noticeable</em>—but it can be far
        more meaningful, especially in the long run. The difference a tiny
        improvement can make over time is astounding. Here’s how the math works
        out: if you can get 1 percent better each day for one year, <span
          id="08_1_The_Surprising_Powe.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText15"></span>you’ll
        end up thirty-seven times better by the time you’re done. Conversely, if
        you get 1 percent worse each day for one year, you’ll decline nearly
        down to zero. What starts as a small win or a minor setback accumulates
        into something much more.</p>
      <h3 class="x05-Head-A">1% BETTER EVERY DAY</h3>
      <p>1% worse every day for one year. 0.99<span class="SUP">365</span> =
        00.03</p>
      <p>1% better every day for one year. 1.01<span class="SUP">365</span> =
        37.78</p>

          alt="FIGURE 1: The effects of small habits compound over time. For example, if you can get just 1 percent better each day, you’ll end up with results that are nearly 37 times better after one year." />
        <figcaption aria-hidden="true"><span class="Figure">FIGURE 1:</span> The
          effects of small habits compound over time. For example, if you can get

          id="08_1_The_Surprising_Powe.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText16"></span>Habits
        are the compound interest of self-improvement. The same way that money
        multiplies through compound interest, the effects of your habits
        multiply as you repeat them. They seem to make little difference on any
        given day and yet the impact they deliver over the months and years can
        be enormous. It is only when looking back two, five, or perhaps ten
        years later that the value of good habits and the cost of bad ones
        becomes strikingly apparent.</p>
      <p>This can be a difficult concept to appreciate in daily life. We often
        <span id="08_1_The_Surprising_Powe.xhtml#page_17" class="pagebreak" title="17"></span>dismiss small changes
        because they don’t seem to
        matter very much in the moment. If you save a little money now, you’re
        still not a millionaire. If you go to the gym three days in a row,
        you’re still out of shape. If you study Mandarin for an hour tonight,
        you still haven’t learned the language. We make a few changes, but the
        results never seem to come quickly and so we slide back into our
        previous routines.
      </p>
      <p>Unfortunately, the slow pace of transformation also makes it easy to
        let a bad habit slide. If you eat an unhealthy meal today, the scale
        doesn’t move much. If you work late tonight and ignore your family, they
        will forgive you. If you procrastinate and put your project off until
        tomorrow, there will usually be time to finish it later. A single
        decision is easy to dismiss.</p>
      <p>But when we repeat 1 percent errors, day after day, by replicating
        poor decisions, duplicating tiny mistakes, and rationalizing little
        excuses, our small choices compound into toxic results. It’s the
        accumulation of many missteps—a 1 percent decline here and there—that
        eventually leads to a problem.</p>
      <p>The impact created by a change in your habits is similar to the
        effect of shifting the route of an airplane by just a few degrees.
        Imagine you are flying from Los Angeles to New York City. If a pilot
        leaving from LAX adjusts the heading just 3.5 degrees south, you will
        land in Washington, D.C., instead of New York. Such a small change is
        barely noticeable at takeoff—the nose of the airplane moves just a few
        feet—but when magnified across the entire United States, you end up
        hundreds of miles apart.<span id="08_1_The_Surprising_Powe.xhtml#footnote-001-backlink"><a
            href="44_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_2" class="_idFootnoteLink noteref" role="doc-noteref">*</a></span></p>
      <p>Similarly, a slight change in your daily habits can guide your life
        to a very different destination. Making a choice that is 1 percent
        better or 1 percent worse seems insignificant in the moment, but over
        the span <span id="08_1_The_Surprising_Powe.xhtml#page_18" class="pagebreak" title="18"></span>of moments that
        make up a lifetime
        these choices determine the difference between who you are and who you
        could be. Success is the product of daily habits—not once-in-a-lifetime
        transformations.</p>
      <p>That said, it doesn’t matter how successful or unsuccessful you are
        right now. What matters is whether your habits are putting you on the
        path toward success. You should be far more concerned with your current
        trajectory than with your current results. If you’re a millionaire but
        you spend more than you earn each month, then you’re on a bad
        trajectory. If your spending habits don’t change, it’s not going to end
        well. Conversely, if you’re broke, but you save a little bit every
        month, then you’re on the path toward financial freedom—even if you’re
        moving slower than you’d like.</p>
      <p>Your outcomes are a lagging measure of your habits. Your net worth is
        a lagging measure of your financial habits. Your weight is a lagging
        measure of your eating habits. Your knowledge is a lagging measure of
        your learning habits. Your clutter is a lagging measure of your cleaning
        habits. You get what you repeat.</p>
      <p>If you want to predict where you’ll end up in life, all you have to
        do is follow the curve of tiny gains or tiny losses, and see how your
        daily choices will compound ten or twenty years down the line. Are you
        spending less than you earn each month? Are you making it into the gym
        each week? Are you reading books and learning something new each day?
        Tiny battles like these are the ones that will define your future
        self.</p>
      <p>Time magnifies the margin between success and failure. It will
        multiply whatever you feed it. Good habits make time your ally. Bad
        habits make time your enemy.</p>
      <p><span id="08_1_The_Surprising_Powe.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText18"></span>Habits
        are a double-edged sword. Bad habits can cut you down just as easily as
        good habits can build you up, which is why understanding the details is
        crucial. You need to know how habits work and how to design them to your
        liking, so you can avoid the dangerous half of the blade.</p>

          one extra task is a small feat on any given day, but it counts for a lot
          over an entire career. The effect of automating an old task or mastering
          a new skill can be even greater. <span id="08_1_The_Surprising_Powe.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText19"></span>The
          more tasks you can handle without thinking, the more your brain is free
          to focus on other areas.</p>
        <p><strong>Knowledge compounds.</strong> Learning one new idea won’t
          make you a genius, but a commitment to lifelong learning can be
          transformative. Furthermore, <span id="08_1_The_Surprising_Powe.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText20"></span>each
          book you read not only teaches you something new but also opens up
          different ways of thinking about old ideas. As Warren Buffett says,
          “That’s how knowledge works. It builds up, like compound interest.”</p>
        <p><strong>Relationships compound.</strong> People reflect your behavior
          back to you. The more you help others, the more others want to help you.
          Being a little bit nicer in each interaction can result in a network of
          broad and strong connections over time.</p>
        <p>Negative Compounding</p>
        <p><strong>Stress compounds.</strong> The frustration of a traffic jam.
          The weight of parenting responsibilities. The worry of making ends meet.
          The strain of slightly high blood pressure. By themselves, these common
          causes of stress are manageable. But when they persist for years, little
          stresses compound into serious health issues.</p>
        <p><strong>Negative thoughts compound.</strong> The more you think of
          yourself as worthless, stupid, or ugly, the more you condition yourself
          to interpret life that way. You get trapped in a thought loop. The same
          is true for how you think about others. Once you fall into the habit of
          seeing people as angry, unjust, or selfish, you see those kind of people
          everywhere.</p>
        <p><strong>Outrage compounds.</strong> Riots, protests, and mass
          movements are rarely the result of a single event. Instead, a long
          series of microaggressions and daily aggravations slowly multiply until
          one event tips the scales and outrage spreads like wildfire.</p>

        PROGRESS IS REALLY LIKE</h3>
      <p>Imagine that you have an ice cube sitting on the table in front of
        you. The room is cold and you can see your breath. It is currently
        twenty-five degrees. Ever so slowly, the room begins to heat up.</p>
      <p>Twenty-six degrees.</p>
      <p>Twenty-seven.</p>
      <p>Twenty-eight.</p>
      <p>The ice cube is still sitting on the table in front of you.</p>
      <p>Twenty-nine degrees.</p>
      <p>Thirty.</p>
      <p>Thirty-one.</p>
      <p>Still, nothing has happened.</p>
      <p>Then, thirty-two degrees. The ice begins to melt. A one-degree shift,
        seemingly no different from the temperature increases before it, has
        unlocked a huge change.</p>
      <p>Breakthrough moments are often the result of many previous actions,
        which build up the potential required to unleash a major change. This
        pattern shows up everywhere. <span id="08_1_The_Surprising_Powe.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText21"></span>Cancer
        spends 80 percent of its life undetectable, then takes over the body in
        months. Bamboo can barely be seen for the first five years as it builds
        extensive root systems underground before exploding ninety feet into the
        air within six weeks.</p>
      <p>Similarly, habits often appear to make no difference until you cross
        a critical threshold and unlock a new level of performance. In the early
        and middle stages of any quest, there is often a Valley of
        Disappointment. You expect to make progress in a linear fashion and it’s
        frustrating how ineffective changes can seem during the first days,
        weeks, and even months. It doesn’t feel like you are going anywhere.
        It’s a hallmark of any compounding process: the most powerful outcomes
        are delayed.</p>
      <p>This is one of the core reasons why it is so hard to build habits
        that <span id="08_1_The_Surprising_Powe.xhtml#page_21" class="pagebreak" title="21"></span>last. People make a
        few small changes, fail to see a
        tangible result, and decide to stop. You think, “I’ve been running every
        day for a month, so why can’t I see any change in my body?” Once this
        kind of thinking takes over, it’s easy to let good habits fall by the
        wayside. But in order to make a meaningful difference, habits need to
        persist long enough to break through this plateau—what I call the
        <em>Plateau of Latent Potential</em>.
      </p>
      <p>If you find yourself struggling to build a good habit or break a bad
        one, it is not because you have lost your ability to improve. It is
        often because you have not yet crossed the Plateau of Latent Potential.
        Complaining about not achieving success despite working hard is like
        complaining about an ice cube not melting when you heated it from
        twenty-five to thirty-one degrees. Your work was not wasted; it is just
        being stored. All the action happens at thirty-two degrees.</p>
      <p>When you finally break through the Plateau of Latent Potential,
        people will call it an overnight success. The outside world only sees
        the most dramatic event rather than all that preceded it. But you know
        that it’s the work you did long ago—when it seemed that you weren’t
        making any progress—that makes the jump today possible.</p>
      <p>It is the human equivalent of geological pressure. Two tectonic
        plates can grind against one another for millions of years, the tension
        slowly building all the while. Then, one day, they rub each other once
        again, in the same fashion they have for ages, but this time the tension
        is too great. An earthquake erupts. Change can take years—before it
        happens all at once.</p>
      <p>Mastery requires patience. <span id="08_1_The_Surprising_Powe.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText22"></span>The San
        Antonio Spurs, one of the most successful teams in NBA history, have a
        quote from social reformer Jacob Riis hanging in their locker room:
        “When nothing seems to help, I go and look at a stonecutter hammering
        away at his rock, perhaps a hundred times without as much as a crack
        showing in it. Yet at the hundred and first blow it will split in two,
        and I know it was not that last blow that did it—but all that had gone
        before.”</p>

      <p>All big things come from small beginnings. <span
          id="08_1_The_Surprising_Powe.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText23"></span>The
        seed of every habit is a single, tiny decision. But as that decision is
        repeated, a habit sprouts and grows stronger. Roots entrench themselves
        and branches grow. The task of breaking a bad habit is like uprooting a
        powerful oak within <span id="08_1_The_Surprising_Powe.xhtml#page_23" class="pagebreak" title="23"></span>us.
        And the task of building a good
        habit is like cultivating a delicate flower one day at a time.</p>
      <p>But what determines whether we stick with a habit long enough to
        survive the Plateau of Latent Potential and break through to the other
        side? What is it that causes some people to slide into unwanted habits
        and enables others to enjoy the compounding effects of good ones?</p>
      <h3 class="x05-Head-A">FORGET ABOUT GOALS, FOCUS ON SYSTEMS INSTEAD</h3>
      <p>Prevailing wisdom claims that the best way to achieve what we want in
        life—getting into better shape, building a successful business, relaxing
        more and worrying less, spending more time with friends and family—is to
        set specific, actionable goals.</p>
      <p>For many years, this was how I approached my habits, too. Each one
        was a goal to be reached. I set goals for the grades I wanted to get in
        school, for the weights I wanted to lift in the gym, for the profits I
        wanted to earn in business. I succeeded at a few, but I failed at a lot
        of them. Eventually, I began to realize that my results had very little
        to do with the goals I set and nearly everything to do with the systems
        I followed.</p>
      <p>What’s the difference between systems and goals? It’s a distinction I
        first learned from Scott Adams, the cartoonist behind the
        <em>Dilbert</em> comic. Goals are about the results you want to achieve.
        Systems are about the processes that lead to those results.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>If you’re a coach, your goal might be to win a championship. Your
            system is the way you recruit players, manage your assistant coaches,
            and conduct practice.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><span id="08_1_The_Surprising_Powe.xhtml#page_24" class="pagebreak" title="24"></span>If you’re an
            entrepreneur, your goal
            might be to build a million-dollar business. Your system is how you test
            product ideas, hire employees, and run marketing campaigns.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>If you’re a musician, your goal might be to play a new piece.
            Your system is how often you practice, how you break down and tackle
            difficult measures, and your method for receiving feedback from your
            instructor.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Now for the interesting question: If you completely ignored your
        goals and focused only on your system, would you still succeed? For
        example, if you were a basketball coach and you ignored your goal to win
        a championship and focused only on what your team does at practice each
        day, would you still get results?</p>
      <p>I think you would.</p>
      <p>The goal in any sport is to finish with the best score, but it would
        be ridiculous to spend the whole game staring at the scoreboard. The
        only way to actually win is to get better each day. In the words of
        three-time Super Bowl winner Bill Walsh, “The score takes care of
        itself.” The same is true for other areas of life. If you want better
        results, then forget about setting goals. Focus on your system
        instead.</p>
      <p>What do I mean by this? Are goals completely useless? Of course not.
        Goals are good for setting a direction, but systems are best for making
        progress. A handful of problems arise when you spend too much time
        thinking about your goals and not enough time designing your
        systems.</p>
      <h4 class="x05-Head-B">Problem #1: Winners and losers have the same
        goals.</h4>
      <p>Goal setting suffers from a serious case of survivorship bias. We
        concentrate on the people who end up winning—the survivors—and <span id="08_1_The_Surprising_Powe.xhtml#page_25"
          class="pagebreak" title="25"></span>mistakenly assume that ambitious goals led to their
        success while overlooking all of the people who had the same objective
        but didn’t succeed.</p>
      <p>Every Olympian wants to win a gold medal. Every candidate wants to
        get the job. And if successful and unsuccessful people share the same
        goals, then <span id="08_1_The_Surprising_Powe.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText24"></span>the
        goal cannot be what differentiates the winners from the losers. It
        wasn’t the <em>goal</em> of winning the Tour de France that propelled
        the British cyclists to the top of the sport. Presumably, they had
        wanted to win the race every year before—just like every other
        professional team. The goal had always been there. It was only when they
        implemented a <em>system</em> of continuous small improvements that they
        achieved a different outcome.</p>
      <h4 class="x05-Head-B">Problem #2: Achieving a goal is only a momentary
        change.</h4>
      <p>Imagine you have a messy room and you set a goal to clean it. If you
        summon the energy to tidy up, then you will have a clean room—for now.
        But if you maintain the same sloppy, pack-rat habits that led to a messy
        room in the first place, soon you’ll be looking at a new pile of clutter
        and hoping for another burst of motivation. You’re left chasing the same
        outcome because you never changed the system behind it. You treated a
        symptom without addressing the cause.</p>
      <p>Achieving a goal only changes your life <em>for the moment</em>.
        That’s the counterintuitive thing about improvement. We think we need to
        change our results, but the results are not the problem. What we really
        need to change are the systems that cause those results. When you solve
        problems at the results level, you only solve them temporarily. In order
        to improve for good, you need to solve problems at the systems level.
        Fix the inputs and the outputs will fix themselves.</p>
      <h4 class="x05-Head-B"><span id="08_1_The_Surprising_Powe.xhtml#page_26" class="pagebreak"
          title="26"></span>Problem #3: Goals restrict your
        happiness.</h4>
      <p>The implicit assumption behind any goal is this: “Once I reach my
        goal, then I’ll be happy.” The problem with a goals-first mentality is
        that you’re continually putting happiness off until the next milestone.
        I’ve slipped into this trap so many times I’ve lost count. For years,
        happiness was always something for my future self to enjoy. I promised
        myself that once I gained twenty pounds of muscle or after my business
        was featured in the <em>New York Times</em>, then I could finally
        relax.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, goals create an “either-or” conflict: either you achieve
        your goal and are successful or you fail and you are a disappointment.
        You mentally box yourself into a narrow version of happiness. This is
        misguided. It is unlikely that your actual path through life will match
        the exact journey you had in mind when you set out. It makes no sense to
        restrict your satisfaction to one scenario when there are many paths to
        success.</p>
      <p>A systems-first mentality provides the antidote. When you fall in
        love with the process rather than the product, you don’t have to wait to
        give yourself permission to be happy. You can be satisfied anytime your
        system is running. And a system can be successful in many different
        forms, not just the one you first envision.</p>
      <h4 class="x05-Head-B">Problem #4: Goals are at odds with long-term
        progress.</h4>
      <p>Finally, a goal-oriented mind-set can create a “yo-yo” effect. Many
        runners work hard for months, but as soon as they cross the finish line,
        they stop training. The race is no longer there to motivate them. When
        all of your hard work is focused on a particular goal, what is left to
        push you forward after you achieve it? This is why many people find
        themselves reverting to their old habits after accomplishing a goal.</p>
      <p><span id="08_1_The_Surprising_Powe.xhtml#page_27" class="pagebreak" title="27"></span>The purpose of setting
        goals is to win the game. The
        purpose of building systems is to continue playing the game. True
        long-term thinking is goal-less thinking. It’s not about any single
        accomplishment. It is about the cycle of endless refinement and
        continuous improvement. Ultimately, it is your commitment to the
        <em>process</em> that will determine your <em>progress</em>.
      </p>
      <h3 class="x05-Head-A">A SYSTEM OF ATOMIC HABITS</h3>
      <p>If you’re having trouble changing your habits, the problem isn’t you.
        The problem is your system. Bad habits repeat themselves again and again
        not because you don’t want to change, but because you have the wrong
        system for change.</p>
      <p>You do not rise to the level of your goals. <span
          id="08_1_The_Surprising_Powe.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText25"></span>You
        fall to the level of your systems.</p>
      <p>Focusing on the overall system, rather than a single goal, is one of
        the core themes of this book. It is also one of the deeper meanings
        behind the word <em>atomic</em>. By now, you’ve probably realized that
        an atomic habit refers to a tiny change, a marginal gain, a 1 percent
        improvement. But atomic habits are not just any old habits, however
        small. They are little habits that are part of a larger system. Just as
        atoms are the building blocks of molecules, atomic habits are the
        building blocks of remarkable results.</p>
      <p>Habits are like the atoms of our lives. Each one is a fundamental
        unit that contributes to your overall improvement. At first, these tiny
        routines seem insignificant, but soon they build on each other and fuel
        bigger wins that multiply to a degree that far outweighs the cost of
        their initial investment. They are both small and mighty. This is the
        meaning of the phrase <em>atomic habits</em>—a regular practice or
        routine that is not only small and easy to do, but also the source of
        incredible power; a component of the system of compound growth.</p>

      <p>W<span class="RunIn">HY IS IT </span>so easy to repeat bad habits and
        so hard to form good ones? Few things can have a more powerful impact on
        your life than improving your daily habits. And yet it is likely that
        this time next year you’ll be doing the same thing rather than something
        better.</p>
      <p>It often feels difficult to keep good habits going for more than a
        few days, even with sincere effort and the occasional burst of
        motivation. Habits like exercise, meditation, journaling, and cooking
        are reasonable for a day or two and then become a hassle.</p>
      <p>However, once your habits are established, they seem to stick around
        forever—especially the unwanted ones. Despite our best intentions,
        unhealthy habits like eating junk food, watching too much television,
        procrastinating, and smoking can feel impossible to break.</p>
      <p>Changing our habits is challenging for two reasons: (1) we try to
        change the wrong thing and (2) we try to change our habits in the wrong
        way. In this chapter, I’ll address the first point. In the chapters that
        follow, I’ll answer the second.</p>
      <p>Our first mistake is that we try to change the wrong thing. To <span

          There are three layers of behavior change: a change in your outcomes, a
          change in your processes, or a change in your identity.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p><strong>The first layer is changing your outcomes.</strong> This
        level is concerned with changing your results: losing weight, publishing
        a book, winning a championship. Most of the goals you set are associated
        with this level of change.</p>
      <p><strong>The second layer is changing your process.</strong> This
        level is concerned with changing your habits and systems: implementing a
        new routine at the gym, decluttering your desk for better workflow,
        developing a meditation practice. Most of the habits you build are
        associated with this level.</p>
      <p><strong>The third and deepest layer is changing your
          identity.</strong> This level is concerned with changing your beliefs:
        your worldview, your self-image, your judgments about yourself and
        others. Most of the beliefs, assumptions, and biases you hold are
        associated with this level.</p>
      <p>Outcomes are about what you get. Processes are about what you do.
        <span id="09_2_How_Your_Habits_Sha.xhtml#page_31" class="pagebreak" title="31"></span>Identity is about what you
        believe. When it comes to
        building habits that last—when it comes to building a system of 1
        percent improvements—the problem is not that one level is “better” or
        “worse” than another. All levels of change are useful in their own way.
        The problem is the <em>direction</em> of change.
      </p>
      <p>Many people begin the process of changing their habits by focusing on
        <em>what</em> they want to achieve. This leads us to outcome-based
        habits. The alternative is to build identity-based habits. With this
        approach, we start by focusing on <em>who</em> we wish to become.

      <p><span id="09_2_How_Your_Habits_Sha.xhtml#page_32" class="pagebreak" title="32"></span>Imagine two people
        resisting a cigarette. When offered
        a smoke, the first person says, “No thanks. I’m trying to quit.” It
        sounds like a reasonable response, but this person still believes they
        are a smoker who is trying to be something else. They are hoping their
        behavior will change while carrying around the same beliefs.</p>
      <p>The second person declines by saying, “No thanks. I’m not a smoker.”
        It’s a small difference, but this statement signals a shift in identity.
        Smoking was part of their former life, not their current one. They no
        longer identify as someone who smokes.</p>
      <p>Most people don’t even consider identity change when they set out to
        improve. They just think, “I want to be skinny (outcome) and if I stick
        to this diet, then I’ll be skinny (process).” They set goals and
        determine the actions they should take to achieve those goals without
        considering the beliefs that drive their actions. They never shift the
        way they look at themselves, and they don’t realize that their old
        identity can sabotage their new plans for change.</p>
      <p>Behind every system of actions are a system of beliefs. The system of
        a democracy is founded on beliefs like freedom, majority rule, and
        social equality. The system of a dictatorship has a very different set
        of beliefs like absolute authority and strict obedience. You can imagine
        many ways to try to get more people to vote in a democracy, but such
        behavior change would never get off the ground in a dictatorship. That’s
        not the identity of the system. Voting is a behavior that is impossible
        under a certain set of beliefs.</p>
      <p>A similar pattern exists whether we are discussing individuals,
        organizations, or societies. There are a set of beliefs and assumptions
        that shape the system, an identity behind the habits.</p>
      <p>Behavior that is incongruent with the self will not last. You may
        want more money, but if your identity is someone who consumes rather
        than creates, then you’ll continue to be pulled toward spending rather
        than earning. You may want better health, but if you continue to <span
          id="09_2_How_Your_Habits_Sha.xhtml#page_33" class="pagebreak" title="33"></span>prioritize comfort over
        accomplishment, you’ll be
        drawn to relaxing rather than training. It’s hard to change your habits
        if you never change the underlying beliefs that led to your past
        behavior. You have a new goal and a new plan, but you haven’t changed
        <em>who</em> you are.
      </p>
      <p>The story of Brian Clark, an entrepreneur from Boulder, Colorado,
        provides a good example. “For as long as I can remember, I’ve chewed my
        fingernails,” Clark told me. “It started as a nervous habit when I was
        young, and then morphed into an undesirable grooming ritual. One day,
        <span id="09_2_How_Your_Habits_Sha.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText27"></span>I
        resolved to stop chewing my nails until they grew out a bit. Through
        mindful willpower alone, I managed to do it.”
      </p>
      <p>Then, Clark did something surprising.</p>
      <p>“I asked my wife to schedule my first-ever manicure,” he said. “My
        thought was that if I started paying to maintain my nails, I wouldn’t
        chew them. And it worked, but not for the monetary reason. What happened
        was the manicure made my fingers look really nice for the first time.
        The manicurist even said that—other than the chewing—I had really
        healthy, attractive nails. Suddenly, I was proud of my fingernails. And
        even though that’s something I had never aspired to, it made all the
        difference. I’ve never chewed my nails since; not even a single close
        call. And it’s because I now take pride in properly caring for
        them.”</p>
      <p>The ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when a habit becomes
        part of your identity. It’s one thing to say I’m the type of person who
        <em>wants</em> this. It’s something very different to say I’m the type
        of person who <em>is</em> this.
      </p>
      <p>The more pride you have in a particular aspect of your identity, the
        more motivated you will be to maintain the habits associated with it. If
        you’re proud of how your hair looks, you’ll develop all sorts of habits
        to care for and maintain it. If you’re proud of the size of your biceps,
        you’ll make sure you never skip an upper-body workout. If you’re proud
        of the scarves you knit, you’ll be more likely to spend hours <span id="09_2_How_Your_Habits_Sha.xhtml#page_34"
          class="pagebreak" title="34"></span>knitting each week. Once your pride gets involved,
        you’ll fight tooth and nail to maintain your habits.</p>
      <p>True behavior change is identity change. You might start a habit
        because of motivation, but the only reason you’ll stick with one is that
        it becomes part of your identity. Anyone can convince themselves to
        visit the gym or eat healthy once or twice, but if you don’t shift the
        belief behind the behavior, then it is hard to stick with long-term
        changes. Improvements are only temporary until they become part of who
        you are.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>The goal is not to read a book, the goal is to <em>become</em> a
            reader.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The goal is not to run a marathon, the goal is to <em>become</em>
            a runner.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The goal is not to learn an instrument, the goal is to

          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Your behaviors are usually a reflection of your identity. What you do
        is an indication of the type of person you believe that you are—either
        consciously or nonconsciously.<span id="09_2_How_Your_Habits_Sha.xhtml#footnote-004-backlink"><a
            href="45_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_1" class="_idFootnoteLink noteref" role="doc-noteref">*</a></span> <span
          id="09_2_How_Your_Habits_Sha.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText28"></span>Research
        has shown that once a person believes in a particular aspect of their
        identity, they are more likely to act in alignment with that belief. For
        example, people who identified as “being a voter” were more likely to
        vote than those who simply claimed “voting” was an action they wanted to
        perform. Similarly, the person who incorporates exercise into their
        identity doesn’t have to convince themselves to train. Doing the right
        thing is easy. After all, when your behavior and your identity are fully
        aligned, you <span id="09_2_How_Your_Habits_Sha.xhtml#page_35" class="pagebreak" title="35"></span>are no longer
        pursuing behavior
        change. You are simply acting like the type of person you already
        believe yourself to be.</p>
      <p>Like all aspects of habit formation, this, too, is a double-edged
        sword. When working for you, identity change can be a powerful force for
        self-improvement. When working against you, though, identity change can
        be a curse. Once you have adopted an identity, it can be easy to let
        your allegiance to it impact your ability to change. Many people walk
        through life in a cognitive slumber, blindly following the norms
        attached to their identity.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>“I’m terrible with directions.”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>“I’m not a morning person.”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>“I’m bad at remembering people’s names.”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>“I’m always late.”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>“I’m not good with technology.”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>“I’m horrible at math.”</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>. . . and a thousand other variations.</p>
      <p>When you have repeated a story to yourself for years, it is easy to
        slide into these mental grooves and accept them as a fact. In time, you
        begin to resist certain actions because “that’s not who I am.” <span
          id="09_2_How_Your_Habits_Sha.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText29"></span>There
        is internal pressure to maintain your self-image and behave in a way
        that is consistent with your beliefs. You find whatever way you can to
        avoid contradicting yourself.</p>
      <p>The more deeply a thought or action is tied to your identity, the
        more difficult it is to change it. It can feel comfortable to believe
        what your culture believes (group identity) or to do what upholds your
        self-image (personal identity), even if it’s wrong. The biggest barrier
        to positive change at any level—individual, team, society—is identity
        conflict. Good habits can make rational sense, but if they conflict with
        your identity, you will fail to put them into action.</p>
      <p><span id="09_2_How_Your_Habits_Sha.xhtml#page_36" class="pagebreak" title="36"></span>On any given day, you may
        struggle with your habits
        because you’re too busy or too tired or too overwhelmed or hundreds of
        other reasons. Over the long run, however, the real reason you fail to
        stick with habits is that your self-image gets in the way. This is why
        you can’t get too attached to one version of your identity. Progress
        requires unlearning. Becoming the best version of yourself requires you
        to continuously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your
        identity.</p>
      <p>This brings us to an important question: If your beliefs and
        worldview play such an important role in your behavior, where do they
        come from in the first place? How, exactly, is your identity formed? And
        how can you emphasize new aspects of your identity that serve you and
        gradually erase the pieces that hinder you?</p>
      <h3 class="x05-Head-A">THE TWO-STEP PROCESS TO CHANGING YOUR
        IDENTITY</h3>
      <p>Your identity emerges out of your habits. You are not born with
        preset beliefs. Every belief, including those about yourself, is learned
        and conditioned through experience.<span id="09_2_How_Your_Habits_Sha.xhtml#footnote-003-backlink"><a
            href="46_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_2" class="_idFootnoteLink noteref" role="doc-noteref">*</a></span></p>
      <p>More precisely, your habits are how you <em>embody</em> your
        identity. When you make your bed each day, you embody the identity of an
        organized person. When you write each day, you embody the identity of a
        creative person. When you train each day, you embody the identity of an
        athletic person.</p>
      <p>The more you repeat a behavior, the more you reinforce the identity
        <span id="09_2_How_Your_Habits_Sha.xhtml#page_37" class="pagebreak" title="37"></span>associated with that
        behavior. In fact, the word
        <em>identity</em> was originally derived from the Latin words
        <em>essentitas</em>, which means <em>being,</em> and <em>identidem</em>,
        which means <em>repeatedly</em>. <span id="09_2_How_Your_Habits_Sha.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText30"></span>Your
        identity is literally your “repeated beingness.”
      </p>
      <p>Whatever your identity is right now, you only believe it because you
        have proof of it. If you go to church every Sunday for twenty years, you
        have evidence that you are religious. If you study biology for one hour
        every night, you have evidence that you are studious. If you go to the
        gym even when it’s snowing, you have evidence that you are committed to
        fitness. The more evidence you have for a belief, the more strongly you
        will believe it.</p>
      <p>For most of my early life, I didn’t consider myself a writer. If you
        were to ask any of my high school teachers or college professors, they
        would tell you I was an average writer at best: certainly not a
        standout. When I began my writing career, I published a new article
        every Monday and Thursday for the first few years. As the evidence grew,
        so did my identity as a writer. I didn’t start out as a writer. I
        <em>became</em> one through my habits.
      </p>
      <p>Of course, your habits are not the <em>only</em> actions that
        influence your identity, but by virtue of their frequency they are
        usually the most important ones. Each experience in life modifies your
        self-image, but it’s unlikely you would consider yourself a soccer
        player because you kicked a ball once or an artist because you scribbled
        a picture. As you repeat these actions, however, the evidence
        accumulates and your self-image begins to change. The effect of one-off
        experiences tends to fade away while the effect of habits gets
        reinforced with time, which means your habits contribute most of the
        evidence that shapes your identity. In this way, the process of building
        habits is actually the process of becoming yourself.</p>
      <p>This is a gradual evolution. We do not change by snapping our <span id="09_2_How_Your_Habits_Sha.xhtml#page_38"
          class="pagebreak" title="38"></span>fingers and deciding to be someone entirely new. <span
          id="09_2_How_Your_Habits_Sha.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText31"></span>We
        change bit by bit, day by day, habit by habit. We are continually
        undergoing microevolutions of the self.</p>
      <p>Each habit is like a suggestion: “Hey, maybe <em>this</em> is who I
        am.” If you finish a book, then perhaps you are the type of person who
        likes reading. If you go to the gym, then perhaps you are the type of
        person who likes exercise. If you practice playing the guitar, perhaps
        you are the type of person who likes music.</p>
      <p>Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to
        become. No single instance will transform your beliefs, but as the votes
        build up, so does the evidence of your new identity. This is one reason
        why meaningful change does not require radical change. Small habits can
        make a meaningful difference by providing evidence of a new identity.
        And if a change is meaningful, it actually is big. That’s the paradox of
        making small improvements.</p>
      <p>Putting this all together, you can see that habits are the path to
        changing your identity. The most practical way to change <em>who</em>
        you are is to change <em>what</em> you do.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Each time you write a page, you are a writer.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Each time you practice the violin, you are a musician.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Each time you start a workout, you are an athlete.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Each time you encourage your employees, you are a
            leader.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Each habit not only gets results but also teaches you something far
        more important: to trust yourself. You start to believe you can actually
        accomplish these things. When the votes mount up and the evidence begins
        to change, the story you tell yourself begins to change as well.</p>
      <p>Of course, it works the opposite way, too. Every time you choose to
        perform a bad habit, it’s a vote for that identity. The good news is
        that <span id="09_2_How_Your_Habits_Sha.xhtml#page_39" class="pagebreak" title="39"></span>you don’t need to be
        perfect. In any election, there
        are going to be votes for both sides. You don’t need a unanimous vote to
        win an election; you just need a majority. It doesn’t matter if you cast
        a few votes for a bad behavior or an unproductive habit. Your goal is
        simply to win the majority of the time.</p>
      <p>New identities require new evidence. If you keep casting the same
        votes you’ve always cast, you’re going to get the same results you’ve
        always had. If nothing changes, nothing is going to change.</p>
      <p>It is a simple two-step process:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>Decide the type of person you want to be.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Prove it to yourself with small wins.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>First, decide who you want to be. This holds at any level—as an
        individual, as a team, as a community, as a nation. What do you want to
        stand for? What are your principles and values? Who do you wish to
        become?</p>
      <p>These are big questions, and many people aren’t sure where to
        begin—but they do know what kind of results they want: to get six-pack
        abs or to feel less anxious or to double their salary. That’s fine.
        Start there and work backward from the results you want to the type of
        person who could get those results. Ask yourself, “Who is the type of
        person that could get the outcome I want?” Who is the type of person
        that could lose forty pounds? Who is the type of person that could learn
        a new language? Who is the type of person that could run a successful
        start-up?</p>
      <p>For example, “Who is the type of person who could write a book?” It’s
        probably someone who is consistent and reliable. Now your focus shifts
        from writing a book (outcome-based) to being the type of person who is
        consistent and reliable (identity-based).</p>
      <p>This process can lead to beliefs like:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><span id="09_2_How_Your_Habits_Sha.xhtml#page_40" class="pagebreak" title="40"></span>“I’m the kind of
            teacher who stands
            up for her students.”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>“I’m the kind of doctor who gives each patient the time and
            empathy they need.”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>“I’m the kind of manager who advocates for her
            employees.”</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Once you have a handle on the type of person you want to be, you can
        begin taking small steps to reinforce your desired identity. I have a
        friend who lost over 100 pounds by asking herself, “What would a healthy
        person do?” All day long, she would use this question as a guide. Would
        a healthy person walk or take a cab? Would a healthy person order a
        burrito or a salad? She figured if she acted like a healthy person long
        enough, eventually she would become that person. She was right.</p>
      <p>The concept of identity-based habits is our first introduction to
        another key theme in this book: feedback loops. Your habits shape your
        identity, and your identity shapes your habits. It’s a two-way street.
        The formation of all habits is a feedback loop (a concept we will
        explore in depth in the next chapter), but it’s important to let your
        values, principles, and identity drive the loop rather than your
        results. The focus should always be on becoming that type of person, not
        getting a particular outcome.</p>
      <h3 class="x05-Head-A">THE REAL REASON HABITS MATTER</h3>
      <p>Identity change is the North Star of habit change. The remainder of
        this book will provide you with step-by-step instructions on how to
        build better habits in yourself, your family, your team, your company,
        and anywhere else you wish. But the true question is: “Are you becoming
        the type of person you want to become?” The first step is not
        <em>what</em> or <em>how</em>, but <em>who</em>. You need to know who
        you want to be. Otherwise, your quest for change is like a boat without
        a rudder. And that’s why we are starting here.
      </p>
      <p><span id="09_2_How_Your_Habits_Sha.xhtml#page_41" class="pagebreak" title="41"></span>You have the power to
        change your beliefs about
        yourself. Your identity is not set in stone. You have a choice in every
        moment. You can choose the identity you want to reinforce today with the
        habits you choose today. And this brings us to the deeper purpose of
        this book and the real reason habits matter.</p>
      <p>Building better habits isn’t about littering your day with life
        hacks. It’s not about flossing one tooth each night or taking a cold
        shower each morning or wearing the same outfit each day. It’s not about
        achieving external measures of success like earning more money, losing
        weight, or reducing stress. Habits can help you achieve all of these
        things, but fundamentally they are not about <em>having</em> something.
        They are about <em>becoming</em> someone.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, your habits matter because they help you become the type
        of person you wish to be. They are the channel through which you develop
        your deepest beliefs about yourself. Quite literally, you become your
        habits.</p>
      <p>Chapter Summary</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>There are three levels of change: outcome change, process change,
            and identity change.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The most effective way to change your habits is to focus not on
            what you want to achieve, but on who you wish to become.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Your identity emerges out of your habits. Every action is a vote
            for the type of person you wish to become.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Becoming the best version of yourself requires you to
            continuously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your
            identity.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The real reason habits matter is not because they can get you
            better results (although they can do that), but because they can change
            your beliefs about <span id="09_2_How_Your_Habits_Sha.xhtml#page_42" class="pagebreak"

        Habits in 4 Simple Steps</h2>
      <p>I<span class="RunIn">N 1898</span>, <span class="RunIn">A
        </span>psychologist named <span id="10_3_How_to_Build_Better.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText32"></span>Edward
        Thorndike conducted an experiment that would lay the foundation for our
        understanding of how habits form and the rules that guide our behavior.
        Thorndike was interested in studying the behavior of animals, and he
        started by working with cats.</p>
      <p>He would place each cat inside a device known as a puzzle box. The
        box was designed so that the cat could escape through a door “<span
          id="10_3_How_to_Build_Better.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText33"></span>by some
        simple act, such as pulling at a loop of cord, pressing a lever, or
        stepping on a platform.” For example, one box contained a lever that,
        when pressed, would open a door on the side of the box. Once the door
        had been opened, the cat could dart out and run over to a bowl of
        food.</p>
      <p>Most cats wanted to escape as soon as they were placed inside the
        box. They would poke their nose into the corners, stick their paws
        through openings, and claw at loose objects. After a few minutes of
        exploration, the cats would happen to press the magical lever, the door
        would open, and they would escape.</p>
      <p>Thorndike tracked the behavior of each cat across many trials. In
        <span id="10_3_How_to_Build_Better.xhtml#page_44" class="pagebreak" title="44"></span>the beginning, the animals
        moved around the box at
        random. But as soon as the lever had been pressed and the door opened,
        the process of learning began. Gradually, each cat learned to associate
        the action of pressing the lever with the reward of escaping the box and
        getting to the food.
      </p>
      <p>After twenty to thirty trials, this behavior became so automatic and
        habitual that the cat could escape within a few seconds. For example,
        Thorndike noted, “Cat 12 took the following times to perform the act.
        160 seconds, 30 seconds, 90 seconds, 60, 15, 28, 20, 30, 22, 11, 15, 20,
        12, 10, 14, 10, 8, 8, 5, 10, 8, 6, 6, 7.”</p>
      <p>During the first three trials, the cat escaped in an average of 1.5
        minutes. During the last three trials, it escaped in an average of 6.3
        seconds. With practice, each cat made fewer errors and their actions
        became quicker and more automatic. Rather than repeat the same mistakes,
        the cat began to cut straight to the solution.</p>
      <p>From his studies, Thorndike described the learning process by
        stating, “<span id="10_3_How_to_Build_Better.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText34"></span>behaviors
        followed by satisfying consequences tend to be repeated and those that
        produce unpleasant consequences are less likely to be repeated.” His
        work provides the perfect starting point for discussing how habits form
        in our own lives. It also provides answers to some fundamental questions
        like: What are habits? And why does the brain bother building them at
        all?</p>
      <h3 class="x05-Head-A">WHY YOUR BRAIN BUILDS HABITS</h3>
      <p>A habit is a behavior that has been repeated enough times to become
        automatic. The process of habit formation begins with trial and error.
        Whenever you encounter a new situation in life, your brain has to make a
        decision. <em>How do I respond to this?</em> The first time you come
        across a problem, you’re not sure how to solve it. Like Thorndike’s cat,
        you’re just trying things out to see what works.</p>
      <p><span id="10_3_How_to_Build_Better.xhtml#page_45" class="pagebreak" title="45"></span><span
          id="10_3_How_to_Build_Better.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText35"></span>Neurological
        activity in the brain is high during this period. You are carefully
        analyzing the situation and making conscious decisions about how to act.
        You’re taking in tons of new information and trying to make sense of it
        all. The brain is busy learning the most effective course of action.</p>
      <p>Occasionally, like a cat pressing on a lever, you stumble across a
        solution. You’re feeling anxious, and you discover that going for a run
        calms you down. You’re mentally exhausted from a long day of work, and
        you learn that playing video games relaxes you. You’re exploring,
        exploring, exploring, and then—BAM—a reward.</p>
      <p>After you stumble upon an unexpected reward, you alter your strategy
        for next time. Your brain immediately begins to catalog the events that
        preceded the reward. <em>Wait a minute—that felt good. What did I do
          right before that?</em></p>
      <p>This is the feedback loop behind all human behavior: try, fail,
        learn, try differently. With practice, the useless movements fade away
        and the useful actions get reinforced. That’s a habit forming.</p>
      <p>Whenever you face a problem repeatedly, your brain begins to automate
        the process of solving it. Your habits are just a series of automatic
        solutions that solve the problems and stresses you face regularly. As
        behavioral scientist Jason Hreha writes, “<span
          id="10_3_How_to_Build_Better.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText36"></span>Habits
        are, simply, reliable solutions to recurring problems in our
        environment.”</p>
      <p><span id="10_3_How_to_Build_Better.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText37"></span>As
        habits are created, the level of activity in the brain
        <em>decreases</em>. You learn to lock in on the cues that predict
        success and tune out everything else. When a similar situation arises in
        the future, you know exactly what to look for. There is no longer a need
        to analyze every angle of a situation. Your brain skips the process of
        trial and error and creates a mental rule: if this, then that. These
        cognitive scripts can be followed automatically whenever the situation
        is appropriate. Now, whenever you feel stressed, you get the itch to
        run. As soon as you walk in the door from work, you grab the video game
        controller. A <span id="10_3_How_to_Build_Better.xhtml#page_46" class="pagebreak" title="46"></span>choice that
        once required effort is
        now automatic. A habit has been created.
      </p>
      <p>Habits are mental shortcuts learned from experience. In a sense, a
        habit is just a memory of the steps you previously followed to solve a
        problem in the past. Whenever the conditions are right, you can draw on
        this memory and automatically apply the same solution. The primary
        reason <span id="10_3_How_to_Build_Better.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText38"></span>the
        brain remembers the past is to better predict what will work in the
        future.</p>
      <p>Habit formation is incredibly useful because <span
          id="10_3_How_to_Build_Better.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText39"></span>the
        conscious mind is the bottleneck of the brain. It can only pay attention
        to one problem at a time. As a result, your brain is always working to
        preserve your conscious attention for whatever task is most essential.
        Whenever possible, <span id="10_3_How_to_Build_Better.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText40"></span>the
        conscious mind likes to pawn off tasks to the nonconscious mind to do
        automatically. This is precisely what happens when a habit is formed.
        <span id="10_3_How_to_Build_Better.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText41"></span>Habits
        reduce cognitive load and free up mental capacity, so you can allocate
        your attention to other tasks.
      </p>
      <p>Despite their efficiency, some people still wonder about the benefits
        of habits. The argument goes like this: “Will habits make my life dull?
        I don’t want to pigeonhole myself into a lifestyle I don’t enjoy.
        Doesn’t so much routine take away the vibrancy and spontaneity of life?”
        Hardly. Such questions set up a false dichotomy. They make you think
        that you have to choose between building habits and attaining freedom.
        In reality, the two complement each other.</p>
      <p>Habits do not restrict freedom. They create it. In fact, the people
        who don’t have their habits handled are often the ones with the
        <em>least</em> amount of freedom. Without good financial habits, you
        will always be struggling for the next dollar. Without good health
        habits, you will always seem to be short on energy. Without good
        learning habits, you will always feel like you’re behind the curve. If
        you’re always being forced to make decisions about simple tasks—when
        should I work out, where do <span id="10_3_How_to_Build_Better.xhtml#page_47" class="pagebreak"
          title="47"></span>I go to write, when do I pay the bills—then you have
        less time for freedom. It’s only by making the fundamentals of life
        easier that you can create the mental space needed for free thinking and
        creativity.
      </p>
      <p>Conversely, when you have your habits dialed in and the basics of
        life are handled and done, your mind is free to focus on new challenges
        and master the next set of problems. Building habits in the present
        allows you to do more of what you want in the future.</p>
      <h3 class="x05-Head-A">THE SCIENCE OF HOW HABITS WORK</h3>
      <p>The process of building a habit can be divided into four simple
        steps: cue, craving, response, and reward.<span id="10_3_How_to_Build_Better.xhtml#footnote-006-backlink"><a
            href="47_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_1" class="_idFootnoteLink noteref" role="doc-noteref">*</a></span> Breaking
        it down into these fundamental
        parts can help us understand what a habit is, how it works, and how to
        improve it.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="./image/005_FourStages.jpg" class="w100"
          alt="FIGURE 5: All habits proceed through four stages in the same order: cue, craving, response, and reward." />
        <figcaption aria-hidden="true"><span class="Figure">FIGURE 5:</span> All
          habits proceed through four stages in the same order: cue, craving,
          response, and reward.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>This four-step pattern is the backbone of every habit, and your brain
        runs through these steps in the same order each time.</p>
      <p>First, there is the cue. The cue triggers your brain to initiate a
        <span id="10_3_How_to_Build_Better.xhtml#page_48" class="pagebreak" title="48"></span>behavior. It is a bit of
        information that predicts a
        reward. Our prehistoric ancestors were paying attention to cues that
        signaled the location of primary rewards like food, water, and sex.
        Today, we spend most of our time learning cues that predict secondary
        rewards like money and fame, power and status, praise and approval, love
        and friendship, or a sense of personal satisfaction. (Of course, these
        pursuits also indirectly improve our odds of survival and reproduction,
        which is the deeper motive behind everything we do.)
      </p>
      <p>Your mind is continuously analyzing your internal and external
        environment for hints of where rewards are located. Because the cue is
        the first indication that we’re close to a reward, it naturally leads to
        a craving.</p>
      <p>Cravings are the second step, and they are the motivational force
        behind every habit. Without some level of motivation or desire—without
        craving a change—we have no reason to act. What you crave is not the
        habit itself but the change in state it delivers. You do not crave
        smoking a cigarette, you crave the feeling of relief it provides. You
        are not motivated by brushing your teeth but rather by the feeling of a
        clean mouth. You do not want to turn on the television, you want to be
        entertained. Every craving is linked to a desire to change your internal
        state. This is an important point that we will discuss in detail
        later.</p>
      <p>Cravings differ from person to person. In theory, any piece of
        information could trigger a craving, but in practice, people are not
        motivated by the same cues. For a gambler, the sound of slot machines
        can be a potent trigger that sparks an intense wave of desire. For
        someone who rarely gambles, the jingles and chimes of the casino are
        just background noise. Cues are meaningless until they are interpreted.
        The thoughts, feelings, and emotions of the observer are what transform
        a cue into a craving.</p>
      <p>The third step is the response. The response is the actual habit you
        perform, which can take the form of a thought or an action. Whether
        <span id="10_3_How_to_Build_Better.xhtml#page_49" class="pagebreak" title="49"></span>a response occurs depends
        on how motivated you are and
        how much friction is associated with the behavior. If a particular
        action requires more physical or mental effort than you are willing to
        expend, then you won’t do it. Your response also depends on your
        ability. It sounds simple, but a habit can occur only if you are capable
        of doing it. If you want to dunk a basketball but can’t jump high enough
        to reach the hoop, well, you’re out of luck.
      </p>
      <p>Finally, the response delivers a reward. Rewards are the end goal of
        every habit. The cue is about noticing the reward. The craving is about
        wanting the reward. The response is about obtaining the reward. We chase
        rewards because they serve two purposes: (1) they satisfy us and (2)
        they teach us.</p>
      <p>The first purpose of rewards is to <em>satisfy your craving</em>.
        Yes, rewards provide benefits on their own. Food and water deliver the
        energy you need to survive. Getting a promotion brings more money and
        respect. Getting in shape improves your health and your dating
        prospects. But the more immediate benefit is that rewards satisfy your
        craving to eat or to gain status or to win approval. At least for a
        moment, rewards deliver contentment and relief from craving.</p>
      <p>Second, rewards teach us which actions are worth remembering in the
        future. Your brain is a reward detector. As you go about your life, your
        sensory nervous system is continuously monitoring which actions satisfy
        your desires and deliver pleasure. <span
          id="10_3_How_to_Build_Better.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText42"></span>Feelings
        of pleasure and disappointment are part of the feedback mechanism that
        helps your brain distinguish useful actions from useless ones. Rewards
        close the feedback loop and complete the habit cycle.</p>
      <p>If a behavior is insufficient in any of the four stages, it will not
        become a habit. Eliminate the cue and your habit will never start.
        Reduce the craving and you won’t experience enough motivation to act.
        Make the behavior difficult and you won’t be able to do it. And if the
        reward fails to satisfy your desire, then you’ll have no reason to do it
        again in <span id="10_3_How_to_Build_Better.xhtml#page_50" class="pagebreak" title="50"></span>the future.
        Without the first three
        steps, a behavior will not occur. Without all four, a behavior will not
        be repeated.</p>
      <h3 class="x05-Head-A">THE HABIT LOOP</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="./image/006_HabitLoop.jpg" class="w100"
          alt="FIGURE 6: The four stages of habit are best described as a feedback loop. They form an endless cycle that is running every moment you are alive.

      </figure>
      <p>In summary, the cue triggers a craving, which motivates a response,
        which provides a reward, which satisfies the craving and, ultimately,
        becomes associated with the cue. Together, these four steps form a
        neurological feedback loop—cue, craving, response, reward; <span id="10_3_How_to_Build_Better.xhtml#page_51"
          class="pagebreak" title="51"></span>cue, craving, response, reward—that ultimately allows
        you to create automatic habits. This cycle is known as the habit
        loop.</p>
      <p>This four-step process is not something that happens occasionally,
        but rather it is an endless feedback loop that is running and active
        during every moment you are alive—even now. The brain is continually
        scanning the environment, predicting what will happen next, trying out
        different responses, and learning from the results. The entire process
        is completed in a split second, and we use it again and again without
        realizing everything that has been packed into the previous moment.</p>
      <p>We can split these four steps into two phases: the problem phase and
        the solution phase. The problem phase includes the cue and the craving,
        and it is when you realize that something needs to change. The solution
        phase includes the response and the reward, and it is when you take
        action and achieve the change you desire.</p>

      </div>
      <p>All behavior is driven by the desire to solve a problem. Sometimes
        the problem is that you notice something good and you want to obtain it.
        Sometimes the problem is that you are experiencing pain and you want to
        relieve it. Either way, the purpose of every habit is to solve the
        problems you face.</p>
      <p>In the table on the following page, you can see a few examples of
        what this looks like in real life.</p>
      <p>Imagine walking into a dark room and flipping on the light switch.
        You have performed this simple habit so many times that it occurs
        without thinking. You proceed through all four stages in the fraction of
        a second. The urge to act strikes you without thinking.</p>

      <p>By the time we become adults, we rarely notice the habits that are
        running our lives. Most of us never give a second thought to the fact
        that we tie the same shoe first each morning, or unplug the toaster
        after each use, or always change into comfortable clothes after getting
        home from work. After decades of mental programming, we automatically
        slip into these patterns of thinking and acting.</p>
      <h3 class="x05-Head-A">THE FOUR LAWS OF BEHAVIOR CHANGE</h3>
      <p>In the following chapters, we will see time and again how the four
        stages of cue, craving, response, and reward influence nearly everything
        we do each day. But before we do that, we need to transform these four
        steps into a practical framework that we can use to design good habits
        and eliminate bad ones.</p>
      <p>I refer to this framework as the <em>Four Laws of Behavior
          Change</em>, and it provides a simple set of rules for creating good
        habits and breaking bad <span id="10_3_How_to_Build_Better.xhtml#page_54" class="pagebreak"
          title="54"></span>ones. You can think of each law as a lever that
        influences human behavior. When the levers are in the right positions,
        creating good habits is effortless. When they are in the wrong
        positions, it is nearly impossible.</p>
      <div class="table">
        <p>How to Create a Good Habit</p>
        <p><strong>The 1st law (Cue):</strong> Make it obvious.</p>
        <p><strong>The 2nd law (Craving):</strong> Make it attractive.</p>
        <p><strong>The 3rd law (Response):</strong> Make it easy.</p>
        <p><strong>The 4th law (Reward):</strong> Make it satisfying.</p>
      </div>
      <p>We can invert these laws to learn how to break a bad habit.</p>
      <div class="table">
        <p>How to Break a Bad Habit</p>
        <p><strong>Inversion of the 1st law (Cue):</strong> Make it

        <p><strong>Inversion of the 4th law (Reward):</strong> Make it

      </div>
      <p>It would be irresponsible for me to claim that these four laws are an
        exhaustive framework for changing <em>any</em> human behavior, but I
        think they’re close. As you will soon see, the Four Laws of Behavior
        Change apply to nearly every field, from sports to politics, art to
        medicine, comedy to management. These laws can be used no matter what
        challenge you are facing. There is no need for completely different
        strategies for each habit.</p>
      <p>Whenever you want to change your behavior, you can simply ask
        yourself:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>How can I make it obvious?</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>How can I make it attractive?</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>How can I make it easy?</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>How can I make it satisfying?</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p><span id="10_3_How_to_Build_Better.xhtml#page_55" class="pagebreak" title="55"></span>If you have ever
        wondered, “Why don’t I do what I say
        I’m going to do? Why don’t I lose the weight or stop smoking or save for
        retirement or start that side business? Why do I say something is
        important but never seem to make time for it?” The answers to those
        questions can be found somewhere in these four laws. The key to creating
        good habits and breaking bad ones is to understand these fundamental
        laws and how to alter them to your specifications. Every goal is doomed
        to fail if it goes against the grain of human nature.</p>
      <p>Your habits are shaped by the systems in your life. In the chapters
        that follow, we will discuss these laws one by one and show how you can
        use them to create a system in which good habits emerge naturally and
        bad habits wither away.</p>
      <p>Chapter Summary</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>A habit is a behavior that has been repeated enough times to
            become automatic.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The ultimate purpose of habits is to solve the problems of life
            with as little energy and effort as possible.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Any habit can be broken down into a feedback loop that involves
            four steps: cue, craving, response, and reward.</p>

        </span>Klein once told me a story about a woman who attended a family
        gathering. She had spent years working as a paramedic and, upon arriving
        at the event, took one look at her father-in-law and got very
        concerned.</p>
      <p>“I don’t like the way you look,” she said.</p>
      <p>Her father-in-law, who was feeling perfectly fine, jokingly replied,
        “Well, I don’t like your looks, either.”</p>
      <p>“No,” she insisted. “You need to go to the hospital now.”</p>
      <p>A few hours later, the man was undergoing lifesaving surgery after an
        examination had revealed that he had a blockage to a major artery and
        was at immediate risk of a heart attack. Without his daughter-in-law’s
        intuition, he could have died.</p>
      <p>What did the paramedic see? How did she predict his impending heart
        attack?</p>
      <p>When major arteries are obstructed, the body focuses on sending blood
        to critical organs and away from peripheral locations near the surface
        of the skin. The result is a change in the pattern of distribution of
        blood in the face. After many years of working with people with <span
          id="12_4_The_Man_Who_Didn_t_.xhtml#page_60" class="pagebreak" title="60"></span>heart failure, the woman had
        unknowingly developed the
        ability to recognize this pattern on sight. She couldn’t explain what it
        was that she noticed in her father-in-law’s face, but she knew something
        was wrong.</p>
      <p>Similar stories exist in other fields. For example, <span
          id="12_4_The_Man_Who_Didn_t_.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText44"></span>military
        analysts can identify which blip on a radar screen is an enemy missile
        and which one is a plane from their own fleet even though they are
        traveling at the same speed, flying at the same altitude, and look
        identical on radar in nearly every respect. During the Gulf War,
        Lieutenant Commander Michael Riley saved an entire battleship when he
        ordered a missile shot down—despite the fact that it looked exactly like
        the battleship’s own planes on radar. He made the right call, but even
        his superior officers couldn’t explain how he did it.</p>
      <p><span id="12_4_The_Man_Who_Didn_t_.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText45"></span>Museum
        curators have been known to discern the difference between an authentic
        piece of art and an expertly produced counterfeit even though they can’t
        tell you precisely which details tipped them off. <span
          id="12_4_The_Man_Who_Didn_t_.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText46"></span>Experienced
        radiologists can look at a brain scan and predict the area where a
        stroke will develop before any obvious signs are visible to the
        untrained eye. I’ve even heard of hairdressers noticing whether a client
        is pregnant based only on the feel of her hair.</p>
      <p><span id="12_4_The_Man_Who_Didn_t_.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText47"></span>The
        human brain is a prediction machine. It is continuously taking in your
        surroundings and analyzing the information it comes across. Whenever you
        experience something repeatedly—like a paramedic seeing the face of a
        heart attack patient or a military analyst seeing a missile on a radar
        screen—your brain begins noticing what is important, sorting through the
        details and highlighting the relevant cues, and cataloging that
        information for future use.</p>
      <p>With enough practice, you can pick up on the cues that predict
        certain outcomes without consciously thinking about it. Automatically,
        your brain encodes the lessons learned through experience. We can’t
        <span id="12_4_The_Man_Who_Didn_t_.xhtml#page_61" class="pagebreak" title="61"></span>always explain what it is
        we are learning, but
        learning is happening all along the way, and your ability to notice the
        relevant cues in a given situation is the foundation for every habit you
        have.
      </p>
      <p>We underestimate how much our brains and bodies can do without
        thinking. You do not tell your hair to grow, your heart to pump, your
        lungs to breathe, or your stomach to digest. And yet your body handles
        all this and more on autopilot. You are much more than your conscious
        self.</p>
      <p>Consider hunger. How do you know when you’re hungry? You don’t
        necessarily have to see a cookie on the counter to realize that it is
        time to eat. Appetite and hunger are governed nonconsciously. Your body
        has a variety of feedback loops that gradually alert you when it is time
        to eat again and that track what is going on around you and within you.
        Cravings can arise thanks to hormones and chemicals circulating through
        your body. Suddenly, you’re hungry even though you’re not quite sure
        what tipped you off.</p>
      <p>This is one of the most surprising insights about our habits: you
        don’t need to be aware of the cue for a habit to begin. You can notice
        an opportunity and take action without dedicating conscious attention to
        it. This is what makes habits useful.</p>
      <p>It’s also what makes them dangerous. As habits form, your actions
        come under the direction of your automatic and nonconscious mind. You
        fall into old patterns before you realize what’s happening. Unless
        someone points it out, you may not notice that you cover your mouth with
        your hand whenever you laugh, that you apologize before asking a
        question, or that you have a habit of finishing other people’s
        sentences. And the more you repeat these patterns, the less likely you
        become to question what you’re doing and why you’re doing it.</p>
      <p>I once heard of a retail clerk who was instructed to cut up empty
        gift cards after customers had used up the balance on the card. One day,
        <span id="12_4_The_Man_Who_Didn_t_.xhtml#page_62" class="pagebreak" title="62"></span>the clerk cashed out a few
        customers in a row who
        purchased with gift cards. When the next person walked up, <span
          id="12_4_The_Man_Who_Didn_t_.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText48"></span>the
        clerk swiped the customer’s actual credit card, picked up the scissors,
        and then cut it in half—entirely on autopilot—before looking up at the
        stunned customer and realizing what had just happened.
      </p>
      <p>Another woman I came across in my research was a former preschool
        teacher who had switched to a corporate job. Even though she was now
        working with adults, her old habits would kick in and <span
          id="12_4_The_Man_Who_Didn_t_.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText49"></span>she
        kept asking coworkers if they had washed their hands after going to the
        bathroom. I also found the <span id="12_4_The_Man_Who_Didn_t_.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText50"></span>story
        of a man who had spent years working as a lifeguard and would
        occasionally yell “Walk!” whenever he saw a child running.</p>
      <p>Over time, the cues that spark our habits become so common that they
        are essentially invisible: the treats on the kitchen counter, the remote
        control next to the couch, the phone in our pocket. Our responses to
        these cues are so deeply encoded that it may feel like the urge to act
        comes from nowhere. For this reason, we must begin the process of
        behavior change with awareness.</p>
      <p>Before we can effectively build new habits, we need to get a handle
        on our current ones. This can be more challenging than it sounds because
        once a habit is firmly rooted in your life, it is mostly nonconscious
        and automatic. If a habit remains mindless, you can’t expect to improve
        it. As the psychologist Carl Jung said, “<span
          id="12_4_The_Man_Who_Didn_t_.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText51"></span>Until
        you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you
        will call it fate.”</p>
      <h3 class="x05-Head-A">THE HABITS SCORECARD</h3>
      <p>The Japanese railway system is regarded as one of the best in the
        world. If you ever find yourself riding a train in Tokyo, you’ll notice
        that the conductors have a peculiar habit.</p>
      <p><span id="12_4_The_Man_Who_Didn_t_.xhtml#page_63" class="pagebreak" title="63"></span>As each operator runs the
        train, they proceed through
        a ritual of pointing at different objects and calling out commands. When
        the train approaches a signal, the operator will point at it and say,
        “Signal is green.” As the train pulls into and out of each station, the
        operator will point at the speedometer and call out the exact speed.
        When it’s time to leave, the operator will point at the timetable and
        state the time. Out on the platform, other employees are performing
        similar actions. Before each train departs, staff members will point
        along the edge of the platform and declare, “All clear!” Every detail is
        identified, pointed at, and named aloud.<span id="12_4_The_Man_Who_Didn_t_.xhtml#footnote-008-backlink"><a
            href="49_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_1" class="_idFootnoteLink noteref" role="doc-noteref">*</a></span></p>
      <p>This process, known as <em>Pointing-and-Calling</em>, is a safety
        system designed to reduce mistakes. It seems silly, but it works
        incredibly well. <span id="12_4_The_Man_Who_Didn_t_.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText52"></span>Pointing-and-Calling
        reduces errors by up to 85 percent and cuts accidents by 30 percent.
        <span id="12_4_The_Man_Who_Didn_t_.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText53"></span>The MTA
        subway system in New York City adopted a modified version that is
        “point-only,” and “within two years of implementation, incidents of
        incorrectly berthed subways fell 57 percent.”
      </p>
      <p>Pointing-and-Calling is so effective because it raises the level of
        awareness from a nonconscious habit to a more conscious level. Because
        the train operators must use their eyes, hands, mouth, and ears, they
        are more likely to notice problems before something goes wrong.</p>
      <p>My wife does something similar. Whenever we are preparing to walk out
        the door for a trip, she verbally calls out the most essential <span id="12_4_The_Man_Who_Didn_t_.xhtml#page_64"
          class="pagebreak" title="64"></span>items in her packing list. “I’ve got my keys. I’ve got
        my wallet. I’ve got my glasses. I’ve got my husband.”</p>
      <p>The more automatic a behavior becomes, the less likely we are to
        consciously think about it. And when we’ve done something a thousand
        times before, we begin to overlook things. We assume that the next time
        will be just like the last. We’re so used to doing what we’ve always
        done that we don’t stop to question whether it’s the right thing to do
        at all. Many of our failures in performance are largely attributable to
        a lack of self-awareness.</p>
      <p>One of our greatest challenges in changing habits is maintaining
        awareness of what we are actually doing. This helps explain why the
        consequences of bad habits can sneak up on us. We need a
        “point-and-call” system for our personal lives. That’s the origin of the
        Habits Scorecard, which is a simple exercise you can use to become more
        aware of your behavior. To create your own, make a list of your daily
        habits.</p>
      <p>Here’s a sample of where your list might start:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Wake up</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Turn off alarm</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Check my phone</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Go to the bathroom</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Weigh myself</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Take a shower</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Brush my teeth</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Floss my teeth</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Put on deodorant</p>
        </li>

          <p>Make a cup of tea</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>. . . and so on.</p>
      <p>Once you have a full list, look at each behavior, and ask yourself,
        “Is this a good habit, a bad habit, or a neutral habit?” If it is a good
        habit, write “+” next to it. If it is a bad habit, write “–”. If it is a
        neutral habit, write “=”.</p>
      <p>For example, the list above might look like this:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><span id="12_4_The_Man_Who_Didn_t_.xhtml#page_65" class="pagebreak" title="65"></span>Wake up =</p>

        <li>
          <p>Turn off alarm =</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Check my phone –</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Go to the bathroom =</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Weigh myself +</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Take a shower +</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Brush my teeth +</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Floss my teeth +</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Put on deodorant +</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Hang up towel to dry =</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Get dressed =</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Make a cup of tea +</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The marks you give to a particular habit will depend on your
        situation and your goals. For someone who is trying to lose weight,
        eating a bagel with peanut butter every morning might be a bad habit.
        For someone who is trying to bulk up and add muscle, the same behavior
        might be a good habit. It all depends on what you’re working
        toward.<span id="12_4_The_Man_Who_Didn_t_.xhtml#footnote-007-backlink"><a href="50_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_2"
            class="_idFootnoteLink noteref" role="doc-noteref">*</a></span></p>
      <p>Scoring your habits can be a bit more complex for another reason as
        well. The labels “good habit” and “bad habit” are slightly inaccurate.
        There are no good habits or bad habits. There are only effective habits.
        That is, effective at solving problems. All habits serve you in some
        way—even the bad ones—which is why you repeat them. For this exercise,
        categorize your habits by how they will benefit you in the long run.
        Generally speaking, good habits will have net positive outcomes. Bad
        habits have net negative outcomes. Smoking a cigarette may reduce stress
        right now (that’s how it’s serving you), but it’s not a healthy
        long-term behavior.</p>
      <p>If you’re still having trouble determining how to rate a particular
        habit, here is a question I like to use: “Does this behavior help me
        become the type of person I wish to be? Does this habit cast a vote for
        or against my desired identity?” Habits that reinforce your desired
        identity are usually good. Habits that conflict with your desired
        identity are usually bad.</p>
      <p>As you create your Habits Scorecard, there is no need to change
        anything at first. The goal is to simply notice what is actually going
        on. Observe your thoughts and actions without judgment or internal <span
          id="12_4_The_Man_Who_Didn_t_.xhtml#page_66" class="pagebreak" title="66"></span>criticism. Don’t blame
        yourself for your faults. Don’t
        praise yourself for your successes.</p>
      <p>If you eat a chocolate bar every morning, acknowledge it, almost as
        if you were watching someone else. <em>Oh, how interesting that they
          would do such a thing.</em> If you binge-eat, simply notice that you are
        eating more calories than you should. If you waste time online, notice
        that you are spending your life in a way that you do not want to.</p>
      <p>The first step to changing bad habits is to be on the lookout for
        them. If you feel like you need extra help, then you can try
        Pointing-and-Calling in your own life. Say out loud the action that you
        are thinking of taking and what the outcome will be. If you want to cut
        back on your junk food habit but notice yourself grabbing another
        cookie, say out loud, “I’m about to eat this cookie, but I don’t need
        it. Eating it will cause me to gain weight and hurt my health.”</p>
      <p>Hearing your bad habits spoken aloud makes the consequences seem more
        real. It adds weight to the action rather than letting yourself
        mindlessly slip into an old routine. This approach is useful even if
        you’re simply trying to remember a task on your to-do list. Just saying
        out loud, “Tomorrow, I need to go to the post office after lunch,”
        increases the odds that you’ll actually do it. You’re getting yourself
        to acknowledge the need for action—and that can make all the
        difference.</p>
      <p>The process of behavior change always starts with awareness.
        Strategies like Pointing-and-Calling and the Habits Scorecard are
        focused on getting you to recognize your habits and acknowledge the cues
        that trigger them, which makes it possible to respond in a way that
        benefits you.</p>

      <p>I<span class="RunIn">N 2001</span>, <span
          id="13_5_The_Best_Way_to_Sta.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText54"></span><span class="RunIn">RESEARCHERS </span>in
        Great Britain began working with 248
        people to build better exercise habits over the course of two weeks. The
        subjects were divided into three groups.</p>
      <p>The first group was the control group. They were simply asked to
        track how often they exercised.</p>
      <p>The second group was the “motivation” group. They were asked not only
        to track their workouts but also to read some material on the benefits
        of exercise. The researchers also explained to the group how exercise
        could reduce the risk of coronary heart disease and improve heart
        health.</p>
      <p>Finally, there was the third group. These subjects received the same
        presentation as the second group, which ensured that they had equal
        levels of motivation. However, they were also asked to formulate a plan
        for when and where they would exercise over the following week.
        Specifically, each member of the third group completed the following
        sentence: “During the next week, I will partake in at least 20 minutes
        of vigorous exercise on [DAY] at [TIME] in [PLACE].”</p>
      <p>In the first and second groups, 35 to 38 percent of people exercised
        <span id="13_5_The_Best_Way_to_Sta.xhtml#page_70" class="pagebreak" title="70"></span>at least once per week.
        (Interestingly, the
        motivational presentation given to the second group seemed to have no
        meaningful impact on behavior.) But 91 percent of the third group
        exercised at least once per week—more than double the normal rate.
      </p>
      <p>The sentence they filled out is what researchers refer to as an
        <em>implementation intention</em>, which is a plan you make beforehand
        about when and where to act. That is, how you <em>intend</em> to
        <em>implement</em> a particular habit.
      </p>
      <p>The cues that can trigger a habit come in a wide range of forms—the
        feel of your phone buzzing in your pocket, the smell of chocolate chip
        cookies, the sound of ambulance sirens—but the two most common cues are
        time and location. Implementation intentions leverage both of these
        cues.</p>
      <p>Broadly speaking, the format for creating an implementation intention
        is:</p>
      <p>“When situation X arises, I will perform response Y.”</p>
      <p>Hundreds of studies have shown that <span
          id="13_5_The_Best_Way_to_Sta.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText55"></span>implementation
        intentions are effective for sticking to our goals, whether it’s <span
          id="13_5_The_Best_Way_to_Sta.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText56"></span>writing
        down the exact time and date of when you will get a flu shot or <span
          id="13_5_The_Best_Way_to_Sta.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText57"></span>recording
        the time of your colonoscopy appointment. They increase the odds that
        people will stick with habits like recycling, studying, going to sleep
        early, and stopping smoking.</p>
      <p>Researchers have even found that <span id="13_5_The_Best_Way_to_Sta.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText58"></span>voter
        turnout increases when people are forced to create implementation
        intentions by answering questions like: “What route are you taking to
        the polling station? At what time are you planning to go? What bus will
        get you there?” <span id="13_5_The_Best_Way_to_Sta.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText59"></span>Other
        successful government programs have prompted citizens to make a clear
        plan to send taxes in on time or provided directions on when and where
        to pay late traffic bills.</p>
      <p>The punch line is clear: <span id="13_5_The_Best_Way_to_Sta.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText60"></span>people
        who make a specific plan for when <span id="13_5_The_Best_Way_to_Sta.xhtml#page_71" class="pagebreak"
          title="71"></span>and where they will perform a new habit are more
        likely to follow through. Too many people try to change their habits
        without these basic details figured out. We tell ourselves, “I’m going
        to eat healthier” or “I’m going to write more,” but we never say when
        and where these habits are going to happen. We leave it up to chance and
        hope that we will “just remember to do it” or feel motivated at the
        right time. An implementation intention sweeps away foggy notions like
        “I want to work out more” or “I want to be more productive” or “I should
        vote” and transforms them into a concrete plan of action.</p>
      <p>Many people think they lack motivation when what they really lack is
        clarity. It is not always obvious when and where to take action. Some
        people spend their entire lives waiting for the time to be right to make
        an improvement.</p>
      <p>Once an implementation intention has been set, you don’t have to wait
        for inspiration to strike. <em>Do I write a chapter today or not? Do I
          meditate this morning or at lunch?</em> When the moment of action
        occurs, there is no need to make a decision. Simply follow your
        predetermined plan.</p>
      <p>The simple way to apply this strategy to your habits is to fill out
        this sentence:</p>
      <p>I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Meditation. I will meditate for one minute at 7 a.m. in my
            kitchen.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Studying. I will study Spanish for twenty minutes at 6 p.m. in my
            bedroom.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Exercise. I will exercise for one hour at 5 p.m. in my local
            gym.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Marriage. I will make my partner a cup of tea at 8 a.m. in the
            kitchen.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you aren’t sure when to start your habit, try the first day of the
        week, month, or year. People are more likely to take action at those
        <span id="13_5_The_Best_Way_to_Sta.xhtml#page_72" class="pagebreak" title="72"></span>times because <span
          id="13_5_The_Best_Way_to_Sta.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText61"></span>hope is
        usually higher. If we have hope, we have a reason to take action. A
        fresh start feels motivating.
      </p>
      <p>There is another benefit to implementation intentions. Being specific
        about what you want and how you will achieve it helps you say no to
        things that derail progress, distract your attention, and pull you off
        course. We often say yes to little requests because we are not clear
        enough about what we need to be doing instead. When your dreams are
        vague, it’s easy to rationalize little exceptions all day long and never
        get around to the specific things you need to do to succeed.</p>
      <p>Give your habits a time and a space to live in the world. The goal is
        to make the time and location so obvious that, with enough repetition,
        you get an urge to do the right thing at the right time, even if you
        can’t say why. As the <span id="13_5_The_Best_Way_to_Sta.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText62"></span>writer
        Jason Zweig noted, “Obviously you’re never going to just work out
        without conscious thought. But like a dog salivating at a bell, maybe
        you start to get antsy around the time of day you normally work
        out.”</p>
      <p>There are <span id="13_5_The_Best_Way_to_Sta.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText63"></span>many
        ways to use implementation intentions in your life and work. My favorite
        approach is one I learned from Stanford professor BJ Fogg and it is a
        strategy I refer to as <em>habit stacking</em>.</p>
      <h3 class="x05-Head-A">HABIT STACKING: A SIMPLE PLAN TO OVERHAUL YOUR
        HABITS</h3>
      <p><span id="13_5_The_Best_Way_to_Sta.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText64"></span>The
        French philosopher Denis Diderot lived nearly his entire life in
        poverty, but that all changed one day in 1765.</p>
      <p>Diderot’s daughter was about to be married and he could not afford to
        pay for the wedding. Despite his lack of wealth, Diderot was well known
        for his role as the co-founder and writer of <em>Encyclopédie</em>, one
        of the most comprehensive encyclopedias of the time. When Catherine the
        Great, the Empress of Russia, heard of Diderot’s financial troubles, her
        heart went out to him. She was a book lover and greatly enjoyed his
        encyclopedia. She offered to buy Diderot’s personal library for <span
          id="13_5_The_Best_Way_to_Sta.xhtml#page_73" class="pagebreak" title="73"></span>£1,000—more than $150,000
        today.<span id="13_5_The_Best_Way_to_Sta.xhtml#footnote-011-backlink"><a href="51_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_1"
            class="_idFootnoteLink noteref" role="doc-noteref">*</a></span> Suddenly, Diderot had money to spare.
        With his new wealth, he not only paid for the wedding but also <span
          id="13_5_The_Best_Way_to_Sta.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText65"></span>acquired
        a scarlet robe for himself.</p>
      <p>Diderot’s scarlet robe was beautiful. So beautiful, in fact, that he
        immediately noticed how out of place it seemed when surrounded by his
        more common possessions. He wrote that there was “<span
          id="13_5_The_Best_Way_to_Sta.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText66"></span>no more
        coordination, no more unity, no more beauty” between his elegant robe
        and the rest of his stuff.</p>
      <p>Diderot soon felt the urge to upgrade his possessions. He replaced
        his rug with one from Damascus. He decorated his home with expensive
        sculptures. He bought a mirror to place above the mantel, and a better
        kitchen table. He tossed aside his old straw chair for a leather one.
        Like falling dominoes, one purchase led to the next.</p>
      <p>Diderot’s behavior is not uncommon. In fact, the tendency for one
        purchase to lead to another one has a name: the Diderot Effect. <span
          id="13_5_The_Best_Way_to_Sta.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText67"></span>The
        Diderot Effect states that obtaining a new possession often creates a
        spiral of consumption that leads to additional purchases.</p>
      <p>You can spot this pattern everywhere. You buy a dress and have to get
        new shoes and earrings to match. You buy a couch and suddenly question
        the layout of your entire living room. You buy a toy for your child and
        soon find yourself purchasing all of the accessories that go with it.
        It’s a chain reaction of purchases.</p>
      <p>Many human behaviors follow this cycle. You often decide what to do
        next based on what you have just finished doing. Going to the bathroom
        leads to washing and drying your hands, which reminds you that you need
        to put the dirty towels in the laundry, so you add laundry detergent to
        the shopping list, and so on. No behavior happens in isolation. Each
        action becomes a cue that triggers the next behavior.</p>
      <p>Why is this important?</p>
      <p><span id="13_5_The_Best_Way_to_Sta.xhtml#page_74" class="pagebreak" title="74"></span>When it comes to building
        new habits, you can use the
        connectedness of behavior to your advantage. One of the best ways to
        build a new habit is to identify a current habit you already do each day
        and then stack your new behavior on top. This is called <em>habit
          stacking</em>.</p>
      <p>Habit stacking is a special form of an implementation intention.
        Rather than pairing your new habit with a particular time and location,
        you pair it with a current habit. This method, <span
          id="13_5_The_Best_Way_to_Sta.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText68"></span>which
        was created by BJ Fogg as part of his Tiny Habits program, can be used
        to design an obvious cue for nearly any habit.<span id="13_5_The_Best_Way_to_Sta.xhtml#footnote-010-backlink"><a
            href="52_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_2" class="_idFootnoteLink noteref" role="doc-noteref">*</a></span></p>
      <p>The habit stacking formula is:</p>
      <p>“After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT].”</p>
      <p>For example:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Meditation. After I pour my cup of coffee each morning, I will
            meditate for one minute.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Exercise. After I take off my work shoes, I will immediately
            change into my workout clothes.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Gratitude. After I sit down to dinner, I will say one thing I’m
            grateful for that happened today.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Marriage. After I get into bed at night, I will give my partner a
            kiss.</p>
        </li>

          <p>Safety. After I put on my running shoes, I will text a friend or
            family member where I am running and how long it will take.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The key is to tie your desired behavior into something you already do
        each day. Once you have mastered this basic structure, you can begin to
        create larger stacks by chaining small habits together. This allows you
        to <span id="13_5_The_Best_Way_to_Sta.xhtml#page_75" class="pagebreak" title="75"></span>take advantage of the
        natural momentum that comes from
        one behavior leading into the next—a positive version of the Diderot
        Effect.</p>

          Habit stacking increases the likelihood that you’ll stick with a habit
          by stacking your new behavior on top of an old one. This process can be
          repeated to chain numerous habits together, each one acting as the cue
          for the next.</figcaption>

      <p>Your morning routine habit stack might look like this:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>After I pour my morning cup of coffee, I will meditate for sixty
            seconds.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>After I meditate for sixty seconds, I will write my to-do list
            for the day.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><span id="13_5_The_Best_Way_to_Sta.xhtml#page_76" class="pagebreak" title="76"></span>After I write my
            to-do list for the
            day, I will immediately begin my first task.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>Or, consider this habit stack in the evening:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>After I finish eating dinner, I will put my plate directly into
            the dishwasher.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>After I put my dishes away, I will immediately wipe down the
            counter.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>After I wipe down the counter, I will set out my coffee mug for
            tomorrow morning.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>You can also insert new behaviors into the middle of your current
        routines. For example, you may already have a morning routine that looks
        like this: Wake up &gt; Make my bed &gt; Take a shower. Let’s say you
        want to develop the habit of reading more each night. You can expand
        your habit stack and try something like: Wake up &gt; Make my bed &gt;
        <em>Place a book on my pillow</em> &gt; Take a shower. Now, when you
        climb into bed each night, a book will be sitting there waiting for you
        to enjoy.
      </p>
      <p>Overall, habit stacking allows you to create a set of simple rules
        that guide your future behavior. It’s like you always have a game plan
        for which action should come next. Once you get comfortable with this
        approach, you can develop general habit stacks to guide you whenever the
        situation is appropriate:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Exercise. When I see a set of stairs, I will take them instead of
            using the elevator.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Social skills. When I walk into a party, I will introduce myself
            to someone I don’t know yet.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Finances. When I want to buy something over $100, I will wait
            twenty-four hours before purchasing.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><span id="13_5_The_Best_Way_to_Sta.xhtml#page_77" class="pagebreak" title="77"></span>Healthy eating. When
            I serve myself
            a meal, I will always put veggies on my plate first.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Minimalism. When I buy a new item, I will give something away.
            (“<span id="13_5_The_Best_Way_to_Sta.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText69"></span>One in,
            one out.”)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Mood. When the phone rings, I will take one deep breath and smile
            before answering.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Forgetfulness. When I leave a public place, I will check the
            table and chairs to make sure I don’t leave anything behind.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>No matter how you use this strategy, the secret to creating a
        successful habit stack is selecting the right cue to kick things off.
        Unlike an implementation intention, which specifically states the time
        and location for a given behavior, habit stacking implicitly has the
        time and location built into it. When and where you choose to insert a
        habit into your daily routine can make a big difference. If you’re
        trying to add meditation into your morning routine but mornings are
        chaotic and your kids keep running into the room, then that may be the
        wrong place and time. Consider when you are most likely to be
        successful. Don’t ask yourself to do a habit when you’re likely to be
        occupied with something else.</p>
      <p>Your cue should also have the same frequency as your desired habit.
        If you want to do a habit every day, but you stack it on top of a habit
        that only happens on Mondays, that’s not a good choice.</p>
      <p>One way to find the right trigger for your habit stack is by
        brainstorming a list of your current habits. You can use your Habits
        Scorecard from the last chapter as a starting point. Alternatively, you
        can create a list with two columns. In the first column, write down the
        habits you do each day without fail.<span id="13_5_The_Best_Way_to_Sta.xhtml#footnote-009-backlink"><a
            href="53_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_3" class="_idFootnoteLink noteref" role="doc-noteref">*</a></span></p>
      <p>For example:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><span id="13_5_The_Best_Way_to_Sta.xhtml#page_78" class="pagebreak" title="78"></span>Get out of bed.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Take a shower.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Brush your teeth.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Get dressed.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Brew a cup of coffee.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Eat breakfast.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Take the kids to school.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Start the work day.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Eat lunch.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>End the work day.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Change out of work clothes.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Sit down for dinner.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Turn off the lights.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Get into bed.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Your list can be much longer, but you get the idea. In the second
        column, write down all of the things that happen to you each day without
        fail. For example:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>The sun rises.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>You get a text message.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The song you are listening to ends.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The sun sets.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Armed with these two lists, you can begin searching for the best
        place to layer your new habit into your lifestyle.</p>
      <p>Habit stacking works best when the cue is highly specific and
        immediately actionable. Many people select cues that are too vague. I
        made this mistake myself. When I wanted to start a push-up habit, my
        habit stack was “When I take a break for lunch, I will do ten push-ups.”
        At first glance, this sounded reasonable. But soon, I realized the
        trigger was unclear. Would I do my push-ups before I ate lunch? After I
        ate lunch? Where would I do them? After a few inconsistent days, I
        changed my habit stack to: “When I close my laptop for lunch, I will do
        ten push-ups next to my desk.” Ambiguity gone.</p>
      <p>Habits like “read more” or “eat better” are worthy causes, but these
        goals do not provide instruction on how and when to act. Be specific and
        clear: After I close the door. After I brush my teeth. After I sit <span
          id="13_5_The_Best_Way_to_Sta.xhtml#page_79" class="pagebreak" title="79"></span>down at the table. The
        specificity is important. The
        more tightly bound your new habit is to a specific cue, the better the
        odds are that you will notice when the time comes to act.</p>
      <p>The 1st Law of Behavior Change is to <em>make it obvious.</em>
        Strategies like implementation intentions and habit stacking are among
        the most practical ways to create obvious cues for your habits and

          class="RunIn">HORNDIKE</span>, <span class="RunIn">A </span>primary care physician at Massachusetts General
        Hospital in Boston, had a crazy idea. She believed she could improve the
        eating habits of thousands of hospital staff and visitors without
        changing their willpower or motivation in the slightest way. In fact,
        she didn’t plan on talking to them at all.</p>
      <p>Thorndike and her colleagues designed a six-month study to alter the
        “choice architecture” of the hospital cafeteria. They started by
        changing how drinks were arranged in the room. Originally, the
        refrigerators located next to the cash registers in the cafeteria were
        filled with only soda. The researchers added water as an option to each
        one. Additionally, they placed baskets of bottled water next to the food
        stations throughout the room. Soda was still in the primary
        refrigerators, but water was now available at <em>all</em> drink
        locations.</p>
      <p>Over the next three months, the number of soda sales at the hospital
        dropped by 11.4 percent. Meanwhile, sales of bottled water increased by
        25.8 percent. They made similar adjustments—and saw similar results—with
        the food in the cafeteria. Nobody had said a word to anyone eating
        there.</p>

          id="14_6_Motivation_Is_Overr.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText71"></span>choose
        products not because of <em>what</em> they are, but because of
        <em>where</em> they are. If I walk into the kitchen and see a plate of
        cookies on the counter, I’ll pick up half a dozen and start eating, even
        if I hadn’t been thinking about them beforehand and didn’t necessarily
        feel hungry. If the communal table at the office is always filled with
        doughnuts and bagels, it’s going to be hard not to grab one every now
        and then. Your habits change depending on the room you are in and the
        cues in front of you.
      </p>
      <p>Environment is the invisible hand that shapes human behavior. <span id="14_6_Motivation_Is_Overr.xhtml#page_83"
          class="pagebreak" title="83"></span>Despite our unique personalities, certain behaviors
        tend to arise again and again under certain environmental conditions. In
        church, people tend to talk in whispers. On a dark street, people act
        wary and guarded. In this way, the most common form of change is not
        internal, but external: we are changed by the world around us. Every
        habit is context dependent.</p>
      <p>In 1936, psychologist Kurt Lewin wrote a simple equation that makes a
        powerful statement: <span id="14_6_Motivation_Is_Overr.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText72"></span>Behavior
        is a function of the Person in their Environment, or B = <em>f</em>
        (P,E).</p>
      <p>It didn’t take long for Lewin’s Equation to be tested in business. In
        1952, the economist Hawkins Stern described a phenomenon he called <span
          id="14_6_Motivation_Is_Overr.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText73"></span><em>Suggestion
          Impulse Buying</em>, which “is triggered when a shopper sees a product
        for the first time and visualizes a need for it.” In other words,
        customers will occasionally buy products not because they <em>want</em>
        them but because of how they are <em>presented</em> to them.</p>
      <p>For example, items at eye level tend to be purchased more than those
        down near the floor. For this reason, you’ll find expensive brand names
        featured in easy-to-reach locations on store shelves because they drive
        the most profit, while cheaper alternatives are tucked away in
        harder-to-reach spots. The same goes for end caps, which are the units
        at the end of aisles. End caps are moneymaking machines for retailers
        because they are obvious locations that encounter a lot of foot traffic.
        For example, <span id="14_6_Motivation_Is_Overr.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText74"></span>45
        percent of Coca-Cola sales come specifically from end-of-the-aisle
        racks.</p>
      <p>The more obviously available a product or service is, the more likely
        you are to try it. <span id="14_6_Motivation_Is_Overr.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText75"></span>People
        drink Bud Light because it is in every bar and visit Starbucks because
        it is on every corner. We like to think that we are in control. If we
        choose water over soda, we assume it is because we wanted to do so. The
        truth, however, is that many of the actions we take each day are shaped
        not by purposeful drive and choice but by the most obvious option.</p>
      <p><span id="14_6_Motivation_Is_Overr.xhtml#page_84" class="pagebreak" title="84"></span>Every living being has
        its own methods for sensing and
        understanding the world. Eagles have remarkable long-distance vision.
        Snakes can smell by “tasting the air” with their highly sensitive
        tongues. Sharks can detect small amounts of electricity and vibrations
        in the water caused by nearby fish. Even bacteria have
        chemoreceptors—tiny sensory cells that allow them to detect toxic
        chemicals in their environment.</p>
      <p>In humans, perception is directed by the sensory nervous system. We
        perceive the world through sight, sound, smell, touch, and taste. But we
        also have other ways of sensing stimuli. Some are conscious, but many
        are nonconscious. For instance, you can “notice” when the temperature
        drops before a storm, or when the pain in your gut rises during a
        stomachache, or when you fall off balance while walking on rocky ground.
        Receptors in your body pick up on a wide range of internal stimuli, such
        as the amount of salt in your blood or the need to drink when
        thirsty.</p>
      <p>The most powerful of all human sensory abilities, however, is vision.
        <span id="14_6_Motivation_Is_Overr.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText76"></span>The
        human body has about eleven million sensory receptors. Approximately ten
        million of those are dedicated to sight. Some experts estimate that
        <span id="14_6_Motivation_Is_Overr.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText77"></span>half of
        the brain’s resources are used on vision. Given that we are more
        dependent on vision than on any other sense, it should come as no
        surprise that visual cues are the greatest catalyst of our behavior. For
        this reason, a small change in what you <em>see</em> can lead to a big
        shift in what you <em>do</em>. As a result, you can imagine how
        important it is to live and work in environments that are filled with
        productive cues and devoid of unproductive ones.
      </p>
      <p>Thankfully, there is good news in this respect. You don’t have to be
        the victim of your environment. You can also be the architect of it.</p>
      <h3 class="x05-Head-A"><span id="14_6_Motivation_Is_Overr.xhtml#page_85" class="pagebreak" title="85"></span>HOW
        TO DESIGN YOUR ENVIRONMENT FOR
        SUCCESS</h3>
      <p>During the energy crisis and oil embargo of the 1970s, Dutch
        researchers began to pay close attention to the country’s energy usage.
        In one suburb near Amsterdam, they found that some homeowners used 30
        percent less energy than their neighbors—despite the homes being of
        similar size and getting electricity for the same price.</p>
      <p>It turned out the houses in this neighborhood were nearly identical
        except for one feature: the location of the electrical meter. Some had
        one in the basement. Others had the electrical meter upstairs in the
        main hallway. As you may guess, the homes with the meters located in the
        main hallway used less electricity. <span id="14_6_Motivation_Is_Overr.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText78"></span>When
        their energy use was obvious and easy to track, people changed their
        behavior.</p>
      <p>Every habit is initiated by a cue, and we are more likely to notice
        cues that stand out. Unfortunately, the environments where we live and
        work often make it easy <em>not</em> to do certain actions because there
        is no obvious cue to trigger the behavior. It’s easy <em>not</em> to
        practice the guitar when it’s tucked away in the closet. It’s easy
        <em>not</em> to read a book when the bookshelf is in the corner of the
        guest room. It’s easy <em>not</em> to take your vitamins when they are
        out of sight in the pantry. When the cues that spark a habit are subtle
        or hidden, they are easy to ignore.

      <p>By comparison, creating obvious visual cues can draw your attention
        toward a desired habit. In the early 1990s, the cleaning staff at
        Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam installed a small sticker that looked like
        a fly near the center of each urinal. Apparently, when men stepped up to
        the urinals, they aimed for what they thought was a bug. The stickers
        improved their aim and significantly reduced “spillage” around the
        urinals. Further analysis determined that <span
          id="14_6_Motivation_Is_Overr.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText79"></span>the
        stickers cut bathroom cleaning costs by 8 percent per year.</p>
      <p>I’ve experienced the power of obvious cues in my own life. I used to
        buy apples from the store, put them in the crisper in the bottom of the
        <span id="14_6_Motivation_Is_Overr.xhtml#page_86" class="pagebreak" title="86"></span>refrigerator, and forget
        all about them. By the time I
        remembered, the apples would have gone bad. I never saw them, so I never
        ate them.
      </p>
      <p>Eventually, I took my own advice and redesigned my environment. I
        bought a large display bowl and placed it in the middle of the kitchen
        counter. The next time I bought apples, that was where they went—out in
        the open where I could see them. Almost like magic, I began eating a few
        apples each day simply because they were obvious rather than out of
        sight.</p>
      <p>Here are a few ways you can redesign your environment and make the
        cues for your preferred habits more obvious:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>If you want to remember to take your medication each night, put
            your pill bottle directly next to the faucet on the bathroom
            counter.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>If you want to practice guitar more frequently, place your guitar
            stand in the middle of the living room.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>If you want to remember to send more thank-you notes, keep a
            stack of stationery on your desk.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>If you want to drink more water, fill up a few water bottles each
            morning and place them in common locations around the house.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you want to make a habit a big part of your life, make the cue a
        big part of your environment. The most persistent behaviors usually have
        multiple cues. Consider how many different ways a smoker could be
        prompted to pull out a cigarette: driving in the car, seeing a friend
        smoke, feeling stressed at work, and so on.</p>
      <p>The same strategy can be employed for good habits. By sprinkling
        triggers throughout your surroundings, you increase the odds that you’ll
        think about your habit throughout the day. Make sure the best choice is
        the most obvious one. Making a better decision is easy and natural when
        the cues for good habits are right in front of you.</p>
      <p><span id="14_6_Motivation_Is_Overr.xhtml#page_87" class="pagebreak" title="87"></span>Environment design is
        powerful not only because it
        influences how we engage with the world but also because we rarely do
        it. Most people live in a world others have created for them. But you
        can alter the spaces where you live and work to increase your exposure
        to positive cues and reduce your exposure to negative ones. Environment
        design allows you to take back control and become the architect of your
        life. Be the designer of your world and not merely the consumer of
        it.</p>
      <h3 class="x05-Head-A">THE CONTEXT IS THE CUE</h3>
      <p>The cues that trigger a habit can start out very specific, but over
        time your habits become associated not with a single trigger but with
        the entire <em>context</em> surrounding the behavior.</p>
      <p>For example, many people drink more in social situations than they
        would ever drink alone. The trigger is rarely a single cue, but rather
        the whole situation: watching your friends order drinks, hearing the
        music at the bar, seeing the beers on tap.</p>
      <p>We mentally assign our habits to the locations in which they occur:
        the home, the office, the gym. Each location develops a connection to
        certain habits and routines. You establish a particular relationship
        with the objects on your desk, the items on your kitchen counter, the
        things in your bedroom.</p>
      <p>Our behavior is not defined by the objects in the environment but by
        our relationship to them. In fact, this is a useful way to think about
        the influence of the environment on your behavior. Stop thinking about
        your environment as filled with objects. Start thinking about it as
        filled with relationships. Think in terms of how you interact with the
        spaces around you. For one person, her couch is the place where she
        reads for an hour each night. For someone else, the couch is where he
        watches television and eats a bowl of ice cream after work. Different
        <span id="14_6_Motivation_Is_Overr.xhtml#page_88" class="pagebreak" title="88"></span>people can have different
        memories—and thus different
        habits—associated with the same place.
      </p>
      <p>The good news? You can train yourself to link a particular habit with
        a particular context.</p>
      <p>In one study, scientists instructed insomniacs to get into bed only
        when they were tired. If they couldn’t fall asleep, they were told to
        sit in a different room until they became sleepy. Over time, subjects
        began to associate the context of their bed with the action of <span
          id="14_6_Motivation_Is_Overr.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText80"></span>sleeping,
        and it became easier to quickly fall asleep when they climbed in bed.
        Their brains learned that sleeping—not browsing on their phones, not
        watching television, not staring at the clock—was the only action that
        happened in that room.</p>
      <p>The power of context also reveals an important strategy: <span
          id="14_6_Motivation_Is_Overr.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText81"></span>habits
        can be easier to change in a new environment. It helps to escape the
        subtle triggers and cues that nudge you toward your current habits. Go
        to a new place—a different coffee shop, a bench in the park, a corner of
        your room you seldom use—and create a new routine there.</p>
      <p>It is easier to associate a new habit with a new context than to
        build a new habit in the face of competing cues. It can be difficult to
        go to bed early if you watch television in your bedroom each night. It
        can be hard to study in the living room without getting distracted if
        that’s where you always play video games. But <span
          id="14_6_Motivation_Is_Overr.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText82"></span>when
        you step outside your normal environment, you leave your behavioral
        biases behind. <span id="14_6_Motivation_Is_Overr.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText83"></span>You
        aren’t battling old environmental cues, which allows new habits to form
        without interruption.</p>
      <p>Want to think more creatively? Move to a bigger room, a rooftop
        patio, or a building with expansive architecture. Take a break from the
        space where you do your daily work, which is also linked to your current
        thought patterns.</p>
      <p>Trying to eat healthier? It is likely that you shop on autopilot at
        your regular supermarket. Try a new grocery store. You may find it
        easier to <span id="14_6_Motivation_Is_Overr.xhtml#page_89" class="pagebreak" title="89"></span>avoid unhealthy
        food when your brain
        doesn’t automatically know where it is located in the store.</p>
      <p>When you can’t manage to get to an entirely new environment, redefine
        or rearrange your current one. Create a separate space for work, study,
        exercise, entertainment, and cooking. The mantra I find useful is “One
        space, one use.”</p>
      <p>When I started my career as an entrepreneur, I would often work from
        my couch or at the kitchen table. In the evenings, I found it very
        difficult to stop working. There was no clear division between the end
        of work time and the beginning of personal time. Was the kitchen table
        my office or the space where I ate meals? Was the couch where I relaxed
        or where I sent emails? Everything happened in the same place.</p>
      <p>A few years later, I could finally afford to move to a home with a
        separate room for my office. Suddenly, work was something that happened
        “in here” and personal life was something that happened “out there.” It
        was easier for me to turn off the professional side of my brain when
        there was a clear dividing line between work life and home life. Each
        room had one primary use. The kitchen was for cooking. The office was
        for working.</p>
      <p>Whenever possible, avoid mixing the context of one habit with
        another. When you start mixing contexts, you’ll start mixing habits—and
        the easier ones will usually win out. This is one reason why the
        versatility of modern technology is both a strength and a weakness. You
        can use your phone for all sorts of tasks, which makes it a powerful
        device. But when you can use your phone to do nearly anything, it
        becomes hard to associate it with one task. You want to be productive,
        but you’re also conditioned to browse social media, check email, and
        play video games whenever you open your phone. It’s a mishmash of
        cues.</p>
      <p>You may be thinking, “You don’t understand. I live in New York City.
        My apartment is the size of a smartphone. I need each room to <span id="14_6_Motivation_Is_Overr.xhtml#page_90"
          class="pagebreak" title="90"></span>play multiple roles.” Fair enough. If your space is
        limited, divide your room into activity zones: a chair for reading, a
        desk for writing, a table for eating. You can do the same with your
        digital spaces. I know a writer who uses his computer only for writing,
        his tablet only for reading, and his phone only for social media and
        texting. Every habit should have a home.</p>
      <p>If you can manage to stick with this strategy, each context will
        become associated with a particular habit and mode of thought. Habits
        thrive under predictable circumstances like these. Focus comes
        automatically when you are sitting at your work desk. Relaxation is
        easier when you are in a space designed for that purpose. Sleep comes
        quickly when it is the only thing that happens in your bedroom. If you
        want behaviors that are stable and predictable, you need an environment
        that is stable and predictable.</p>
      <p>A stable environment where everything has a place and a purpose is an
        environment where habits can easily form.</p>

      <p>I<span class="RunIn">N 1971</span>, as the Vietnam War was heading
        into its sixteenth year, congressmen Robert Steele from Connecticut and
        Morgan Murphy from Illinois made a discovery that stunned the American
        public. While visiting the troops, they had learned that over 15 percent
        of U.S. soldiers stationed there were heroin addicts. <span
          id="15_7_The_Secret_to_Self-.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText84"></span>Follow-up
        research revealed that 35 percent of service members in Vietnam had
        tried heroin and as many as 20 percent were addicted—the problem was
        even worse than they had initially thought.</p>
      <p>The discovery led to a flurry of activity in Washington, including
        <span id="15_7_The_Secret_to_Self-.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText85"></span>the
        creation of the Special Action Office of Drug Abuse Prevention under
        President Nixon to promote prevention and rehabilitation and to track
        addicted service members when they returned home.
      </p>
      <p>Lee Robins was one of the researchers in charge. In a finding that
        completely upended the accepted beliefs about addiction, Robins found
        that when soldiers who had been heroin users returned home, only 5
        percent of them became re-addicted within a year, and just 12 percent
        relapsed within three years. In other words, approximately <span
          id="15_7_The_Secret_to_Self-.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText86"></span>nine
        out of <span id="15_7_The_Secret_to_Self-.xhtml#page_92" class="pagebreak" title="92"></span>ten soldiers who
        used heroin in
        Vietnam eliminated their addiction nearly overnight.</p>
      <p>This finding contradicted the prevailing view at the time, which
        considered heroin addiction to be a permanent and irreversible
        condition. Instead, Robins revealed that addictions could spontaneously
        dissolve if there was a radical change in the environment. In Vietnam,
        soldiers spent all day surrounded by cues triggering heroin use: it was
        easy to access, they were engulfed by the constant stress of war, they
        built friendships with fellow soldiers who were also heroin users, and
        they were thousands of miles from home. Once a soldier returned to the
        United States, though, he found himself in an environment devoid of
        those triggers. When the context changed, so did the habit.</p>
      <p>Compare this situation to that of a typical drug user. Someone
        becomes addicted at home or with friends, goes to a clinic to get
        clean—which is devoid of all the environmental stimuli that prompt their
        habit—then returns to their old neighborhood with all of their previous
        cues that caused them to get addicted in the first place. It’s no wonder
        that usually you see numbers that are the exact opposite of those in the
        Vietnam study. Typically, <span id="15_7_The_Secret_to_Self-.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText87"></span>90
        percent of heroin users become re-addicted once they return home from
        rehab.</p>
      <p>The Vietnam studies ran counter to many of our cultural beliefs about
        bad habits because it challenged the conventional association of
        unhealthy behavior as a moral weakness. If you’re overweight, a smoker,
        or an addict, you’ve been told your entire life that it is because you
        lack self-control—maybe even that you’re a bad person. The idea that a
        little bit of discipline would solve all our problems is deeply embedded
        in our culture.</p>
      <p>Recent research, however, shows something different. When scientists
        analyze people who appear to have tremendous self-control, it turns out
        those individuals aren’t all that different from those who are
        struggling. Instead, “<span id="15_7_The_Secret_to_Self-.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText88"></span>disciplined”
        people are better at structuring their <span id="15_7_The_Secret_to_Self-.xhtml#page_93" class="pagebreak"
          title="93"></span>lives in a way that <em>does not require</em> heroic
        willpower and self-control. In other words, they spend less time in
        tempting situations.</p>
      <p>The people with the best self-control are typically the ones who need
        to use it the least. <span id="15_7_The_Secret_to_Self-.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText89"></span>It’s
        easier to practice self-restraint when you don’t have to use it very
        often. So, yes, perseverance, grit, and willpower are essential to
        success, but the way to improve these qualities is not by wishing you
        were a more disciplined person, but by creating a more disciplined
        environment.</p>
      <p>This counterintuitive idea makes even more sense once you understand
        what happens when a habit is formed in the brain. <span
          id="15_7_The_Secret_to_Self-.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText90"></span>A habit
        that has been encoded in the mind is ready to be used whenever the
        relevant situation arises. When Patty Olwell, a therapist from Austin,
        Texas, started smoking, she would often light up while riding horses
        with a friend. Eventually, she quit smoking and avoided it for years.
        She had also stopped riding. Decades later, she hopped on a horse again
        and found herself craving a cigarette for the first time in forever.
        <span id="15_7_The_Secret_to_Self-.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText91"></span>The
        cues were still internalized; she just hadn’t been exposed to them in a
        long time.
      </p>
      <p>Once a habit has been encoded, the urge to act follows whenever the
        environmental cues reappear. This is one reason behavior change
        techniques can backfire. <span id="15_7_The_Secret_to_Self-.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText92"></span>Shaming
        obese people with weight-loss presentations can make them feel stressed,
        and as a result many people return to their favorite coping strategy:
        overeating. <span id="15_7_The_Secret_to_Self-.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText93"></span>Showing
        pictures of blackened lungs to smokers leads to higher levels of
        anxiety, which drives many people to reach for a cigarette. If you’re
        not careful about cues, you can cause the very behavior you want to
        stop.</p>
      <p>Bad habits are autocatalytic: the process feeds itself. They foster
        the feelings they try to numb. You feel bad, so you eat junk food.
        Because you eat junk food, you feel bad. Watching television makes you
        feel sluggish, so you watch more television because you don’t have the
        energy to do anything else. Worrying about your health makes you feel
        <span id="15_7_The_Secret_to_Self-.xhtml#page_94" class="pagebreak" title="94"></span>anxious, which causes you
        to smoke to ease your
        anxiety, which makes your health even worse and soon you’re feeling more
        anxious. It’s a downward spiral, a runaway train of bad habits.
      </p>
      <p>Researchers refer to this phenomenon as “cue-induced wanting”: an
        external trigger causes a compulsive craving to repeat a bad habit. Once
        you <em>notice</em> something, you begin to <em>want</em> it. This
        process is happening all the time—often without us realizing it.
        Scientists have found that <span id="15_7_The_Secret_to_Self-.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText94"></span>showing
        addicts a picture of cocaine for just thirty-three milliseconds
        stimulates the reward pathway in the brain and sparks desire. This speed
        is too fast for the brain to consciously register—the addicts couldn’t
        even tell you what they had seen—but they craved the drug all the
        same.</p>
      <p>Here’s the punch line: You can break a habit, but you’re unlikely to
        forget it. Once the mental grooves of habit have been carved into your
        brain, they are nearly impossible to remove entirely—even if they go
        unused for quite a while. And that means that simply resisting
        temptation is an ineffective strategy. It is hard to maintain a Zen
        attitude in a life filled with interruptions. It takes too much energy.
        In the short-run, you can choose to overpower temptation. In the
        long-run, we become a product of the environment that we live in. To put
        it bluntly, I have never seen someone consistently stick to positive
        habits in a negative environment.</p>
      <p>A more reliable approach is to cut bad habits off at the source. One
        of the most practical ways to eliminate a bad habit is to reduce
        exposure to the cue that causes it.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>If you can’t seem to get any work done, leave your phone in
            another room for a few hours.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>If you’re continually feeling like you’re not enough, stop
            following social media accounts that trigger jealousy and envy.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><span id="15_7_The_Secret_to_Self-.xhtml#page_95" class="pagebreak" title="95"></span>If you’re wasting too
            much time
            watching television, move the TV out of the bedroom.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>If you’re spending too much money on electronics, quit reading
            reviews of the latest tech gear.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>If you’re playing too many video games, unplug the console and
            put it in a closet after each use.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>This practice is an inversion of the 1st Law of Behavior Change.
        Rather than <em>make it obvious</em>, you can <em>make it
          invisible</em>. I’m often surprised by how effective simple changes like
        these can be. Remove a single cue and the entire habit often fades
        away.</p>
      <p>Self-control is a short-term strategy, not a long-term one. You may
        be able to resist temptation once or twice, but it’s unlikely you can
        muster the willpower to override your desires every time. Instead of
        summoning a new dose of willpower whenever you want to do the right
        thing, your energy would be better spent optimizing your environment.
        This is the secret to self-control. Make the cues of your good habits
        obvious and the cues of your bad habits invisible.</p>

        Irresistible</h2>
      <p>I<span class="RunIn">N THE 1940S</span>, a Dutch scientist named
        <span id="17_8_How_to_Make_a_Habit.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText95"></span>Niko
        Tinbergen performed a series of experiments that transformed our
        understanding of what motivates us. Tinbergen—who eventually won a Nobel
        Prize for his work—was investigating herring gulls, the gray and white
        birds often seen flying along the seashores of North America.
      </p>
      <p>Adult herring gulls have a small red dot on their beak, and Tinbergen
        noticed that newly hatched chicks would peck this spot whenever they
        wanted food. To begin one experiment, he created a collection of fake
        cardboard beaks, just a head without a body. When the parents had flown
        away, he went over to the nest and offered these dummy beaks to the
        chicks. The beaks were obvious fakes, and he assumed the baby birds
        would reject them altogether.</p>
      <p>However, when the tiny gulls saw the red spot on the cardboard beak,
        they pecked away just as if it were attached to their own mother. They
        had a clear preference for those red spots—as if they had been
        genetically programmed at birth. Soon Tinbergen discovered that the
        bigger the red spot, the faster the chicks pecked. Eventually, he
        created a beak with three large red dots on it. When he placed it over
        the nest, <span id="17_8_How_to_Make_a_Habit.xhtml#page_102" class="pagebreak" title="102"></span>the baby birds
        went crazy with
        delight. They pecked at the little red patches as if it was the greatest
        beak they had ever seen.</p>
      <p>Tinbergen and his colleagues discovered similar behavior in other
        animals. For example, the greylag goose is a ground-nesting bird.
        Occasionally, as the mother moves around on the nest, one of the eggs
        will roll out and settle on the grass nearby. Whenever this happens, the
        goose will waddle over to the egg and use its beak and neck to pull it
        back into the nest.</p>
      <p>Tinbergen discovered that <span id="17_8_How_to_Make_a_Habit.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText96"></span>the
        goose will pull <em>any</em> nearby round object, such as a billiard
        ball or a lightbulb, back into the nest. The bigger the object, the
        greater their response. One goose even made a tremendous effort to roll
        a volleyball back and sit on top. Like the baby gulls automatically
        pecking at red dots, the greylag goose was following an instinctive
        rule: <em>When I see a round object nearby, I must roll it back into the
          nest. The bigger the round object, the harder I should try to get
          it.</em></p>
      <p>It’s like the brain of each animal is preloaded with certain rules
        for behavior, and when it comes across an exaggerated version of that
        rule, it lights up like a Christmas tree. Scientists refer to these
        exaggerated cues as <em>supernormal stimuli</em>. A supernormal stimulus
        is a heightened version of reality—like a beak with three red dots or an
        egg the size of a volleyball—and it elicits a stronger response than
        usual.</p>
      <p>Humans are also prone to fall for exaggerated versions of reality.
        Junk food, for example, drives our reward systems into a frenzy. After
        spending hundreds of thousands of years hunting and foraging for food in
        the wild, the human brain has evolved to place a high value on salt,
        sugar, and fat. Such foods are often calorie-dense and they were quite
        rare when our ancient ancestors were roaming the savannah. When you
        don’t know where your next meal is coming from, eating as much as
        possible is an excellent strategy for survival.</p>
      <p>Today, however, we live in a calorie-rich environment. Food is <span
          id="17_8_How_to_Make_a_Habit.xhtml#page_103" class="pagebreak" title="103"></span>abundant, but your brain
        continues to crave it like
        it is scarce. Placing a high value on salt, sugar, and fat is no longer
        advantageous to our health, but the craving persists because the brain’s
        reward centers have not changed for approximately fifty thousand years.
        <span id="17_8_How_to_Make_a_Habit.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText97"></span>The
        modern food industry relies on stretching our Paleolithic instincts
        beyond their evolutionary purpose.
      </p>
      <p>A primary goal of food science is to create products that are more
        attractive to consumers. <span id="17_8_How_to_Make_a_Habit.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText98"></span>Nearly
        every food in a bag, box, or jar has been enhanced in some way, if only
        with additional flavoring. Companies spend millions of dollars to
        discover the most satisfying level of crunch in a potato chip or the
        perfect amount of fizz in a soda. Entire departments are dedicated to
        optimizing how a product feels in your mouth—a quality known as
        <em>orosensation</em>. <span id="17_8_How_to_Make_a_Habit.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText99"></span>French
        fries, for example, are a potent combination—golden brown and crunchy on
        the outside, light and smooth on the inside.
      </p>
      <p>Other processed foods enhance <em>dynamic contrast</em>, which refers
        to items with a combination of sensations, like crunchy and creamy.
        Imagine the gooeyness of melted cheese on top of a crispy pizza crust,
        or the crunch of an Oreo cookie combined with its smooth center. With
        natural, unprocessed foods, you tend to experience the same sensations
        over and over—<em>how’s that seventeenth bite of kale taste?</em> After
        a few minutes, your brain loses interest and you begin to feel full. But
        foods that are high in dynamic contrast keep the experience novel and
        interesting, encouraging you to eat more.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, <span id="17_8_How_to_Make_a_Habit.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText100"></span>such
        strategies enable food scientists to find the “bliss point” for each
        product—the precise combination of salt, sugar, and fat that excites
        your brain and keeps you coming back for more. The result, of course, is
        that you overeat because hyperpalatable foods are more attractive to the
        human brain. As Stephan Guyenet, a neuroscientist who specializes in
        eating behavior and obesity, says, “<span
          id="17_8_How_to_Make_a_Habit.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText101"></span>We’ve
        gotten too good at pushing our own buttons.”</p>
      <p><span id="17_8_How_to_Make_a_Habit.xhtml#page_104" class="pagebreak" title="104"></span>The modern food
        industry, and the overeating habits
        it has spawned, is just one example of the 2nd Law of Behavior Change:
        <em>Make it attractive.</em> The more attractive an opportunity is, the
        more likely it is to become habit-forming.
      </p>
      <p>Look around. Society is filled with highly engineered versions of
        reality that are more attractive than the world our ancestors evolved
        in. Stores feature mannequins with exaggerated hips and breasts to sell
        clothes. Social media delivers more “likes” and praise in a few minutes
        than we could ever get in the office or at home. Online porn splices
        together stimulating scenes at a rate that would be impossible to
        replicate in real life. Advertisements are created with a combination of
        ideal lighting, professional makeup, and Photoshopped edits—even the
        model doesn’t look like the person in the final image. These are the
        supernormal stimuli of our modern world. They exaggerate features that
        are naturally attractive to us, and our instincts go wild as a result,
        driving us into excessive shopping habits, social media habits, porn
        habits, eating habits, and many others.</p>
      <p>If history serves as a guide, the opportunities of the future will be
        more attractive than those of today. The trend is for rewards to become
        more concentrated and stimuli to become more enticing. Junk food is a
        more concentrated form of calories than natural foods. Hard liquor is a
        more concentrated form of alcohol than beer. Video games are a more
        concentrated form of play than board games. Compared to nature, these
        pleasure-packed experiences are hard to resist. We have the brains of
        our ancestors but temptations they never had to face.</p>
      <p>If you want to increase the odds that a behavior will occur, then you
        need to make it attractive. Throughout our discussion of the 2nd Law,
        our goal is to learn how to make our habits irresistible. While it is
        not possible to transform every habit into a supernormal stimulus, we
        can make any habit more enticing. To do this, we must start by
        understanding what a craving is and how it works.</p>
      <p><span id="17_8_How_to_Make_a_Habit.xhtml#page_105" class="pagebreak" title="105"></span>We begin by examining a
        biological signature that all
        habits share—the dopamine spike.</p>
      <h3 class="x05-Head-A">THE DOPAMINE-DRIVEN FEEDBACK LOOP</h3>
      <p>Scientists can track the precise moment a craving occurs by measuring
        a neurotransmitter called dopamine.<span id="17_8_How_to_Make_a_Habit.xhtml#footnote-012-backlink"><a
            href="54_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_1" class="_idFootnoteLink noteref" role="doc-noteref">*</a></span> <span
          id="17_8_How_to_Make_a_Habit.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText102"></span>The
        importance of dopamine became apparent in 1954 when the neuroscientists
        James Olds and Peter Milner ran an experiment that revealed the <span
          id="17_8_How_to_Make_a_Habit.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText103"></span>neurological
        processes behind craving and desire. By implanting electrodes in the
        brains of rats, the researchers blocked the release of dopamine. To the
        surprise of the scientists, the <span id="17_8_How_to_Make_a_Habit.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText104"></span>rats
        lost all will to live. They wouldn’t eat. They wouldn’t have sex. They
        didn’t crave anything. Within a few days, the animals died of
        thirst.</p>
      <p>In follow-up studies, other scientists also inhibited the
        dopamine-releasing parts of the brain, but this time, they squirted
        little droplets of sugar into the mouths of the dopamine-depleted rats.
        Their little rat faces lit up with pleasurable grins from the tasty
        substance. Even though dopamine was blocked, they <em>liked</em> the
        sugar just as much as before; they just didn’t <em>want</em> it anymore.
        The ability to experience pleasure remained, but without dopamine,
        desire died. And <span id="17_8_How_to_Make_a_Habit.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText105"></span>without
        desire, action stopped.</p>
      <p>When other researchers reversed this process and flooded the reward
        system of the brain with dopamine, animals performed habits at breakneck
        speed. In one study, mice received a powerful hit of dopamine each time
        they poked their nose in a box. Within minutes, <span
          id="17_8_How_to_Make_a_Habit.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText106"></span>the
        <span id="17_8_How_to_Make_a_Habit.xhtml#page_106" class="pagebreak" title="106"></span>mice developed a craving
        so strong they began poking
        their nose into the box eight hundred times per hour. (Humans are not so
        different: <span id="17_8_How_to_Make_a_Habit.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText107"></span>the
        average slot machine player will spin the wheel six hundred times per
        hour.)
      </p>
      <p><span id="17_8_How_to_Make_a_Habit.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText108"></span>Habits
        are a <span id="17_8_How_to_Make_a_Habit.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText109"></span>dopamine-driven
        feedback loop. Every behavior that is highly habit-forming—taking drugs,
        eating junk food, playing video games, browsing social media—is
        associated with higher levels of dopamine. The same can be said for our
        most basic habitual behaviors like eating food, drinking water, having
        sex, and interacting socially.</p>
      <p>For years, scientists assumed dopamine was all about pleasure, but
        now we know it plays a central role in many neurological processes,
        including motivation, learning and memory, punishment and aversion, and
        voluntary movement.</p>
      <p>When it comes to habits, the key takeaway is this: <span
          id="17_8_How_to_Make_a_Habit.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText110"></span>dopamine
        is released not only when you <em>experience</em> pleasure, but also
        when you <em>anticipate</em> it. Gambling addicts have a dopamine spike
        right <em>before</em> they place a bet, not after they win. Cocaine
        addicts get a surge of dopamine when they <em>see</em> the powder, not
        after they take it. Whenever you predict that an opportunity will be
        rewarding, your levels of dopamine spike in anticipation. And <span
          id="17_8_How_to_Make_a_Habit.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText111"></span>whenever
        dopamine rises, so does your motivation to act.</p>
      <p>It is the anticipation of a reward—not the fulfillment of it—that
        gets us to take action.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, <span id="17_8_How_to_Make_a_Habit.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText112"></span>the
        reward system that is activated in the brain when you <em>receive</em> a
        reward is the same system that is activated when you <em>anticipate</em>
        a reward. This is one reason the anticipation of an experience can often
        feel better than the attainment of it. As a child, thinking about
        Christmas morning can be better than opening the gifts. As an adult,
        daydreaming about an upcoming vacation can be more enjoyable than
        actually being on vacation. Scientists refer to this as the difference
        between “wanting” and “liking.”</p>

      </figure>
      <p><span id="17_8_How_to_Make_a_Habit.xhtml#page_108" class="pagebreak" title="108"></span>Your brain has far more
        neural circuitry allocated
        for <em>wanting</em> rewards than for <em>liking</em> them. The wanting
        centers in the brain are large: the brain stem, the nucleus accumbens,
        the ventral tegmental area, the dorsal striatum, the amygdala, and
        portions of the prefrontal cortex. By comparison, the liking centers of
        the brain are much smaller. They are often referred to as “hedonic hot
        spots” and are distributed like tiny islands throughout the brain. For
        instance, researchers have found that <span
          id="17_8_How_to_Make_a_Habit.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText113"></span>100
        percent of the nucleus accumbens is activated during wanting. Meanwhile,
        only 10 percent of the structure is activated during liking.</p>
      <p>The fact that the brain allocates so much precious space to the
        regions responsible for craving and desire provides further evidence of
        the crucial role these processes play. Desire is the engine that drives
        behavior. Every action is taken because of the anticipation that
        precedes it. It is the craving that leads to the response.</p>
      <p>These insights reveal the importance of the 2nd Law of Behavior
        Change. We need to make our habits attractive because it is the
        expectation of a rewarding experience that motivates us to act in the
        first place. This is where a strategy known as temptation bundling comes
        into play.</p>
      <h3 class="x05-Head-A">HOW TO USE TEMPTATION BUNDLING TO MAKE YOUR
        HABITS MORE ATTRACTIVE</h3>
      <p>Ronan Byrne, an electrical engineering student in Dublin, Ireland,
        enjoyed watching Netflix, but he also knew that he should exercise more
        often than he did. Putting his engineering skills to use, <span
          id="17_8_How_to_Make_a_Habit.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText114"></span>Byrne
        hacked his stationary bike and connected it to his laptop and
        television. Then he wrote a computer program that would allow Netflix to
        run <em>only</em> if he was cycling at a certain speed. If he slowed
        down for too long, whatever show he was watching would pause until he
        started pedaling again. He was, in the words of one fan, “<span

        temptation bundling to make his
        exercise habit more attractive. Temptation bundling works by linking an
        action you want to do with an action you need to do. In Byrne’s case, he
        bundled watching Netflix (the thing he wanted to do) with riding his
        stationary bike (the thing he needed to do).</p>
      <p>Businesses are masters at temptation bundling. For instance, when the
        American Broadcasting Company, more commonly known as ABC, launched its
        Thursday-night television lineup for the 2014–2015 season, they promoted
        temptation bundling on a massive scale.</p>
      <p>Every Thursday, the company would air three shows created by
        screenwriter Shonda Rhimes—<em>Grey’s Anatomy</em>, <em>Scandal</em>,
        and <em>How to Get Away with Murder</em>. They branded it as “TGIT on
        ABC” (TGIT stands for Thank God It’s Thursday). In addition to promoting
        the shows, ABC encouraged viewers to make popcorn, drink red wine, and
        enjoy the evening.</p>
      <p>Andrew Kubitz, head of scheduling for ABC, described the idea behind
        the campaign: “<span id="17_8_How_to_Make_a_Habit.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText116"></span>We see
        Thursday night as a viewership opportunity, with either couples or women
        by themselves who want to sit down and escape and have fun and drink
        their red wine and have some popcorn.” The brilliance of this strategy
        is that ABC was associating the thing they <em>needed</em> viewers to do
        (watch their shows) with activities their viewers already
        <em>wanted</em> to do (relax, drink wine, and eat popcorn).
      </p>
      <p>Over time, people began to connect watching ABC with feeling relaxed
        and entertained. If you drink red wine and eat popcorn at 8 p.m. every
        Thursday, then eventually “8 p.m. on Thursday” <em>means</em> relaxation
        and entertainment. The reward gets associated with the cue, and the
        habit of turning on the television becomes more attractive.</p>
      <p>You’re more likely to find a behavior attractive if you get to do one
        of your favorite things at the same time. Perhaps you want to hear about
        the latest celebrity gossip, but you need to get in shape. Using
        temptation bundling, you could only read the tabloids and watch <span
          id="17_8_How_to_Make_a_Habit.xhtml#page_110" class="pagebreak" title="110"></span>reality shows at the gym.
        Maybe you want to get a
        pedicure, but you need to clean out your email inbox. Solution: only get
        a pedicure while processing overdue work emails.</p>
      <p>Temptation bundling is one way to apply a psychology theory known as
        Premack’s Principle. Named after the work of professor David Premack,
        the principle states that “<span id="17_8_How_to_Make_a_Habit.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText117"></span>more
        probable behaviors will reinforce less probable behaviors.” In other
        words, even if you don’t really want to process overdue work emails,
        you’ll become conditioned to do it if it means you get to do something
        you really want to do along the way.</p>
      <p>You can even combine temptation bundling with the habit stacking
        strategy we discussed in Chapter 5 to create a set of rules to guide
        your behavior.</p>
      <p>The habit stacking + temptation bundling formula is:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [HABIT I NEED].</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>After [HABIT I NEED], I will [HABIT I WANT].</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>If you want to read the news, but you need to express more
        gratitude:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>After I get my morning coffee, I will say one thing I’m grateful
            for that happened yesterday (need).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>After I say one thing I’m grateful for, I will read the news
            (want).</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>If you want to watch sports, but you need to make sales calls:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>After I get back from my lunch break, I will call three potential
            clients (need).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>After I call three potential clients, I will check ESPN
            (want).</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p><span id="17_8_How_to_Make_a_Habit.xhtml#page_111" class="pagebreak" title="111"></span>If you want to check
        Facebook, but you need to
        exercise more:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>After I pull out my phone, I will do ten burpees (need).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>After I do ten burpees, I will check Facebook (want).</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>The hope is that eventually you’ll look forward to calling three
        clients or doing ten burpees because it means you get to read the latest
        sports news or check Facebook. Doing the thing you need to do means you
        get to do the thing you want to do.</p>
      <p>We began this chapter by discussing supernormal stimuli, which are
        heightened versions of reality that increase our desire to take action.
        Temptation bundling is one way to create a heightened version of any
        habit by connecting it with something you already want. Engineering a
        truly irresistible habit is a hard task, but this simple strategy can be
        employed to make nearly any habit more attractive than it would be
        otherwise.</p>

        and Friends in Shaping Your Habits</h2>
      <p>I<span class="RunIn">N</span><span class="RunIn"> 1965</span>, a
        Hungarian man named Laszlo Polgar wrote a series of strange letters to a
        woman named Klara.</p>
      <p>Laszlo was a firm believer in hard work. In fact, it was all he
        believed in: he completely rejected the idea of innate talent. He
        claimed that with deliberate practice and the development of good
        habits, a child could become a genius in any field. His mantra was
        “<span id="18_9_The_Role_of_Family_.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText118"></span>A
        genius is not born, but is educated and trained.”</p>
      <p>Laszlo believed in this idea so strongly that he wanted to test it
        with his own children—and he was writing to Klara because he “needed a
        wife willing to jump on board.” Klara was a teacher and, although she
        may not have been as adamant as Laszlo, she also believed that with
        proper instruction, anyone could advance their skills.</p>
      <p>Laszlo decided chess would be a suitable field for the experiment,
        and he laid out a plan to raise his children to become chess prodigies.
        The kids would be home-schooled, a rarity in Hungary at the time. The
        house would be filled with chess books and pictures of famous chess
        players. The children would play against each other constantly and
        compete in the best tournaments they could find. The family would <span
          id="18_9_The_Role_of_Family_.xhtml#page_114" class="pagebreak" title="114"></span>keep a meticulous file
        system of the tournament
        history of every competitor the children faced. Their lives would be
        dedicated to chess.</p>
      <p>Laszlo successfully courted Klara, and within a few years, the
        Polgars were parents to three young girls: Susan, Sofia, and Judit.</p>
      <p>Susan, the oldest, began playing chess when she was four years old.
        Within six months, she was defeating adults.</p>
      <p>Sofia, the middle child, did even better. By fourteen, she was a
        world champion, and a few years later, she became a grandmaster.</p>
      <p>Judit, the youngest, was the best of all. By age five, she could beat
        her father. At twelve, she was the youngest player ever listed among the
        top one hundred chess players in the world. At fifteen years and four
        months old, she became the youngest grandmaster of all time—younger than
        Bobby Fischer, the previous record holder. For twenty-seven years, she
        was the number-one-ranked female chess player in the world.</p>
      <p>The childhood of the Polgar sisters was atypical, to say the least.
        And yet, if you ask them about it, they claim their lifestyle was
        attractive, even enjoyable. In interviews, the sisters talk about their
        childhood as entertaining rather than grueling. They loved playing
        chess. They couldn’t get enough of it. Once, Laszlo reportedly found
        Sofia playing chess in the bathroom in the middle of the night.
        Encouraging her to go back to sleep, he said, “Sofia, leave the pieces
        alone!” To which she replied, “Daddy, <em>they</em> won’t leave
        <em>me</em> alone!”
      </p>
      <p>The Polgar sisters grew up in a culture that prioritized chess above
        all else—praised them for it, rewarded them for it. In their world, an
        obsession with chess was normal. And as we are about to see, whatever
        habits are normal in your culture are among the most attractive
        behaviors you’ll find.</p>
      <h3 class="x05-Head-A"><span id="18_9_The_Role_of_Family_.xhtml#page_115" class="pagebreak" title="115"></span>THE
        SEDUCTIVE PULL OF SOCIAL NORMS</h3>
      <p>Humans are herd animals. We want to fit in, to bond with others, and
        to earn the respect and approval of our peers. Such inclinations are
        essential to our survival. For most of our evolutionary history, our
        ancestors lived in tribes. Becoming separated from the tribe—or worse,
        being cast out—was a death sentence. “The lone wolf dies, but the pack
        survives.”<span id="18_9_The_Role_of_Family_.xhtml#footnote-013-backlink"><a href="55_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_1"
            class="_idFootnoteLink noteref" role="doc-noteref">*</a></span></p>
      <p>Meanwhile, those who collaborated and bonded with others enjoyed
        increased safety, mating opportunities, and access to resources. As
        Charles Darwin noted, “In the long history of humankind, those who
        learned to collaborate and improvise most effectively have prevailed.”
        As a result, one of the deepest human desires is to belong. And this
        ancient preference exerts a powerful influence on our modern
        behavior.</p>
      <p>We don’t choose our earliest habits, we imitate them. We follow the
        script handed down by our friends and family, our church or school, our
        local community and society at large. Each of these cultures and groups
        comes with its own set of expectations and standards—when and whether to
        get married, how many children to have, which holidays to celebrate, how
        much money to spend on your child’s birthday party. In many ways, these
        social norms are the invisible rules that guide your behavior each day.
        You’re always keeping them in mind, even if they are at the not top of
        your mind. Often, you follow the habits of your culture without
        thinking, without questioning, and sometimes without remembering. As the
        French philosopher Michel de Montaigne wrote, “The customs and practices
        of life in society sweep us along.”</p>
      <p>Most of the time, going along with the group does not feel like a
        burden. Everyone wants to belong. If you grow up in a family that <span
          id="18_9_The_Role_of_Family_.xhtml#page_116" class="pagebreak" title="116"></span>rewards you for your chess
        skills, playing chess will
        seem like a very attractive thing to do. If you work in a job where
        everyone wears expensive suits, then you’ll be inclined to splurge on
        one as well. If all of your friends are sharing an inside joke or using
        a new phrase, you’ll want to do it, too, so they know that you “get it.”
        Behaviors are attractive when they help us fit in.</p>
      <p><span id="18_9_The_Role_of_Family_.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText119"></span>We
        imitate the habits of three groups in particular:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>The close.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The many.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The powerful.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>Each group offers an opportunity to leverage the 2nd Law of Behavior
        Change and make our habits more attractive.</p>
      <h4 class="x05-Head-B">1. Imitating the Close</h4>
      <p>Proximity has a powerful effect on our behavior. This is true of the
        physical environment, as we discussed in Chapter 6, but it is also true
        of the social environment.</p>
      <p>We pick up habits from the people around us. We copy the way our
        parents handle arguments, the way our peers flirt with one another, the
        way our coworkers get results. When your friends smoke pot, you give it
        a try, too. When your wife has a habit of double-checking that the door
        is locked before going to bed, you pick it up as well.</p>
      <p>I find that I often imitate the behavior of those around me without
        realizing it. In conversation, I’ll automatically assume the body
        posture of the other person. In college, I began to talk like my
        roommates. When traveling to other countries, I unconsciously imitate
        the local accent despite reminding myself to stop.</p>
      <p>As a general rule, the closer we are to someone, the more likely we
        <span id="18_9_The_Role_of_Family_.xhtml#page_117" class="pagebreak" title="117"></span>are to imitate some of
        their habits. One
        groundbreaking study tracked twelve thousand people for thirty-two years
        and found that “<span id="18_9_The_Role_of_Family_.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText120"></span>a
        person’s chances of becoming obese increased by 57 percent if he or she
        had a friend who became obese.” It works the other way, too. Another
        study found that <span id="18_9_The_Role_of_Family_.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText121"></span>if one
        person in a relationship lost weight, the other partner would also slim
        down about one third of the time. Our friends and family provide a sort
        of invisible peer pressure that pulls us in their direction.
      </p>
      <p>Of course, peer pressure is bad only if you’re surrounded by bad
        influences. When astronaut Mike Massimino was a graduate student at MIT,
        he took a small robotics class. <span id="18_9_The_Role_of_Family_.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText122"></span>Of the
        ten people in the class, <em>four</em> became astronauts. If your goal
        was to make it into space, then that room was about the best culture you
        could ask for. Similarly, one study found that <span
          id="18_9_The_Role_of_Family_.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText123"></span>the
        higher your best friend’s IQ at age eleven or twelve, the higher your IQ
        would be at age fifteen, even after controlling for natural levels of
        intelligence. We soak up the qualities and practices of those around
        us.</p>
      <p>One of the most effective things you can do to build better habits is
        to join a culture where your desired behavior is the normal behavior.
        New habits seem achievable when you see others doing them every day. If
        you are surrounded by fit people, you’re more likely to consider working
        out to be a common habit. If you’re surrounded by jazz lovers, you’re
        more likely to believe it’s reasonable to play jazz every day. Your
        culture sets your expectation for what is “normal.” Surround yourself
        with people who have the habits you want to have yourself. You’ll rise
        together.</p>
      <p>To make your habits even more attractive, you can take this strategy
        one step further.</p>
      <p>Join a culture where (1) your desired behavior is the normal behavior
        and (2) you already have something in common with the group. Steve Kamb,
        an entrepreneur in New York City, runs a company called <span id="18_9_The_Role_of_Family_.xhtml#page_118"
          class="pagebreak" title="118"></span>Nerd Fitness, which “helps nerds, misfits, and
        mutants lose weight, get strong, and get healthy.” His clients include
        video game lovers, movie fanatics, and average Joes who want to get in
        shape. Many people feel out of place the first time they go to the gym
        or try to change their diet, but if you are already similar to the other
        members of the group in some way—say, your mutual love of <em>Star
          Wars</em>—change becomes more appealing because it feels like something
        people like you already do.</p>
      <p>Nothing sustains motivation better than belonging to the tribe. It
        transforms a personal quest into a shared one. Previously, you were on
        your own. Your identity was singular. <em>You are a reader. You are a
          musician. You are an athlete.</em> When you join a book club or a band
        or a cycling group, your identity becomes linked to those around you.
        Growth and change is no longer an individual pursuit. <em>We are
          readers. We are musicians. We are cyclists.</em> The shared identity
        begins to reinforce your personal identity. This is why remaining part
        of a group after achieving a goal is crucial to maintaining your habits.
        It’s friendship and community that embed a new identity and help
        behaviors last over the long run.</p>
      <h4 class="x05-Head-B">2. Imitating the Many</h4>
      <p>In the 1950s, psychologist <span id="18_9_The_Role_of_Family_.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText124"></span>Solomon
        Asch conducted a series of experiments that are now taught to legions of
        undergrads each year. To begin each experiment, the subject entered the
        room with a group of strangers. Unbeknownst to them, the other
        participants were actors planted by the researcher and instructed to
        deliver scripted answers to certain questions.</p>
      <p>The group would be shown one card with a line on it and then a second
        card with a series of lines. Each person was asked to select the line on
        the second card that was similar in length to the line on the first
        card. It was a very simple task. Here is an example of two cards used in
        the experiment:</p>
      <h3 class="x05-Head-A">CONFORMING TO SOCIAL NORMS</h3>

        <figcaption aria-hidden="true">FIGURE 10: This is a representation of
          two cards used by Solomon Asch in his famous social conformity

      </figure>
      <p><span id="18_9_The_Role_of_Family_.xhtml#page_119" class="pagebreak" title="119"></span>The experiment always
        began the same. First, there
        would be some easy trials where everyone agreed on the correct line.
        After a few rounds, the participants were shown a test that was just as
        obvious as the previous ones, except the actors in the room would select
        an intentionally <em>incorrect</em> answer. For example, they would
        respond “A” to the comparison shown in Figure 10. Everyone would agree
        that the lines were the same even though they were clearly
        different.</p>
      <p>The subject, who was unaware of the ruse, would immediately <span id="18_9_The_Role_of_Family_.xhtml#page_120"
          class="pagebreak" title="120"></span>become bewildered. Their eyes would open wide. They
        would laugh nervously to themselves. They would double-check the
        reactions of other participants. Their agitation would grow as one
        person after another delivered the same incorrect response. Soon, the
        subject began to doubt their own eyes. Eventually, they delivered the
        answer they knew in their heart to be incorrect.</p>
      <p>Asch ran this experiment many times and in many different ways. What
        he discovered was that as the number of actors increased, so did the
        conformity of the subject. If it was just the subject and one actor,
        then there was no effect on the person’s choice. They just assumed they
        were in the room with a dummy. When two actors were in the room with the
        subject, there was still little impact. But as the number of people
        increased to three actors and four and all the way to eight, the subject
        became more likely to second-guess themselves. <span
          id="18_9_The_Role_of_Family_.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText125"></span>By the
        end of the experiment, nearly 75 percent of the subjects had agreed with
        the group answer even though it was obviously incorrect.</p>
      <p>Whenever we are unsure how to act, we look to the group to guide our
        behavior. We are constantly scanning our environment and wondering,
        “What is everyone else doing?” We check reviews on Amazon or Yelp or
        TripAdvisor because we want to imitate the “best” buying, eating, and
        travel habits. It’s usually a smart strategy. There is evidence in
        numbers.</p>
      <p>But there can be a downside.</p>
      <p>The normal behavior of the tribe often overpowers the desired
        behavior of the individual. For example, one study found that when <span
          id="18_9_The_Role_of_Family_.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText126"></span>a
        chimpanzee learns an effective way to crack nuts open as a member of one
        group and then switches to a new group that uses a less effective
        strategy, it will avoid using the superior nut cracking method just to
        blend in with the rest of the chimps.</p>
      <p>Humans are similar. There is tremendous internal pressure to comply
        with the norms of the group. The reward of being accepted is often <span
          id="18_9_The_Role_of_Family_.xhtml#page_121" class="pagebreak" title="121"></span>greater than the reward of
        winning an argument,
        looking smart, or finding truth. Most days, we’d rather be wrong with
        the crowd than be right by ourselves.</p>
      <p>The human mind knows how to get along with others. It <em>wants</em>
        to get along with others. This is our natural mode. You can override
        it—you can choose to ignore the group or to stop caring what other
        people think—but it takes work. Running against the grain of your
        culture requires extra effort.</p>
      <p>When changing your habits means challenging the tribe, change is
        unattractive. When changing your habits means fitting in with the tribe,
        change is very attractive.</p>
      <h4 class="x05-Head-B">3. Imitating the Powerful</h4>
      <p>Humans everywhere pursue power, prestige, and status. We want pins
        and medallions on our jackets. We want President or Partner in our
        titles. We want to be acknowledged, recognized, and praised. This
        tendency can seem vain, but overall, it’s a smart move. Historically, a
        person with greater power and status has access to more resources,
        worries less about survival, and proves to be a more attractive
        mate.</p>
      <p>We are drawn to behaviors that earn us respect, approval, admiration,
        and status. We want to be the one in the gym who can do muscle-ups or
        the musician who can play the hardest chord progressions or the parent
        with the most accomplished children because these things separate us
        from the crowd. Once we fit in, we start looking for ways to stand
        out.</p>
      <p>This is one reason we care so much about the habits of highly
        effective people. We try to copy the behavior of successful people
        because we desire success ourselves. Many of our daily habits are
        imitations of people we admire. You replicate the marketing strategies
        of the most successful firms in your industry. You make a recipe from
        your <span id="18_9_The_Role_of_Family_.xhtml#page_122" class="pagebreak" title="122"></span>favorite baker. You
        borrow the
        storytelling strategies of your favorite writer. You mimic the
        communication style of your boss. We imitate people we envy.</p>
      <p>High-status people enjoy the approval, respect, and praise of others.
        And that means if a behavior can get us approval, respect, and praise,
        we find it attractive.</p>
      <p>We are also motivated to avoid behaviors that would lower our status.
        We trim our hedges and mow our lawn because we don’t want to be the slob
        of the neighborhood. When our mother comes to visit, we clean up the
        house because we don’t want to be judged. We are continually wondering
        “What will others think of me?” and altering our behavior based on the
        answer.</p>
      <p>The Polgar sisters—the chess prodigies mentioned at the beginning of
        this chapter—are evidence of the powerful and lasting impact social
        influences can have on our behavior. The sisters practiced chess for
        many hours each day and continued this remarkable effort for decades.
        But these habits and behaviors maintained their attractiveness, in part,
        because they were valued by their culture. From the praise of their
        parents to the achievement of different status markers like becoming a
        grandmaster, they had many reasons to continue their effort.</p>

          <p>The culture we live in determines which behaviors are attractive
            to us.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>We tend to adopt habits that are praised and approved of by our

            tribe.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>We tend to imitate the habits of three social groups: the close

            status and prestige).</p>

            effective things
            you can do to build better habits is to join a culture where (1) your

        the Causes of Your Bad Habits</h2>
      <p>I<span class="RunIn">N</span> <span class="RunIn">LATE</span><span class="RunIn"> 2012</span>, I was sitting in
        an old apartment just a few
        blocks from Istanbul’s most famous street, Istiklal Caddesi. I was in
        the middle of a four-day trip to Turkey and my guide, Mike, was relaxing
        in a worn-out armchair a few feet away.</p>
      <p>Mike wasn’t really a guide. He was just a guy from Maine who had been
        living in Turkey for five years, but he offered to show me around while
        I was visiting the country and I took him up on it. On this particular
        night, I had been invited to dinner with him and a handful of his
        Turkish friends.</p>
      <p>There were seven of us, and I was the only one who hadn’t, at some
        point, smoked at least one pack of cigarettes per day. I asked one of
        the Turks how he got started. “Friends,” he said. “It always starts with
        your friends. One friend smokes, then you try it.”</p>
      <p>What was truly fascinating was that half of the people in the room
        had managed to <em>quit</em> smoking. Mike had been smoke-free for a few
        years at that point, and he swore up and down that he broke the habit
        because of a book called <em>Allen Carr’s Easy Way to Stop
          Smoking</em>.</p>
      <p>“It frees you from the mental burden of smoking,” he said. “It tells
        <span id="19_10_How_to_Find_and_Fi.xhtml#page_126" class="pagebreak" title="126"></span>you: ‘Stop lying to
        yourself. You know you don’t
        actually want to smoke. You know you don’t really enjoy this.’ It helps
        you feel like you’re not the victim anymore. You start to realize that
        you don’t <em>need</em> to smoke.”
      </p>
      <p>I had never tried a cigarette, but I took a look at the book
        afterward out of curiosity. The author employs an interesting strategy
        to help smokers eliminate their cravings. He systematically reframes
        each cue associated with smoking and gives it a new meaning.</p>
      <p>He says things like:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>You think you are quitting something, but you’re not quitting
            anything because cigarettes do nothing for you.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>You think smoking is something you need to do to be social, but
            it’s not. You can be social without smoking at all.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>You think smoking is about relieving stress, but it’s not.
            Smoking does not relieve your nerves, it destroys them.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Over and over, he repeats these phrases and others like them. “Get it
        clearly into your mind,” he says. “You are losing nothing and you are
        making marvelous positive gains not only in health, energy and money but
        also in confidence, self-respect, freedom and, most important of all, in
        the length and quality of your future life.”</p>
      <p>By the time you get to the end of the book, smoking seems like the
        most ridiculous thing in the world to do. And if you no longer expect
        smoking to bring you any benefits, you have no reason to smoke. It is an
        inversion of the 2nd Law of Behavior Change: <em>make it
          unattractive</em>.</p>
      <p>Now, I know this idea might sound overly simplistic. Just change your
        mind and you can quit smoking. But stick with me for a minute.</p>
      <h3 class="x05-Head-A"><span id="19_10_How_to_Find_and_Fi.xhtml#page_127" class="pagebreak"
          title="127"></span>WHERE CRAVINGS COME FROM</h3>
      <p>Every behavior has a surface level craving and a deeper, underlying
        motive. I often have a craving that goes something like this: “I want to
        eat tacos.” If you were to ask me why I want to eat tacos, <span
          id="19_10_How_to_Find_and_Fi.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText127"></span>I
        wouldn’t say, “Because I need food to survive.” But the truth is,
        somewhere deep down, I am motivated to eat tacos because I have to eat
        to survive. The underlying motive is to obtain food and water even if my
        specific craving is for a taco.</p>
      <p>Some of our underlying motives include:<span id="19_10_How_to_Find_and_Fi.xhtml#footnote-014-backlink"><a
            href="56_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_1" class="_idFootnoteLink noteref" role="doc-noteref">*</a></span></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Conserve energy</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Obtain food and water</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Find love and reproduce</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Connect and bond with others</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Win social acceptance and approval</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Reduce uncertainty</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Achieve status and prestige</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>A craving is just a specific manifestation of a deeper underlying
        motive. Your brain did not evolve with a desire to smoke cigarettes or
        to check Instagram or to play video games. At a deep level, you simply
        want to reduce uncertainty and relieve anxiety, to win social acceptance
        and approval, or to achieve status.</p>
      <p>Look at nearly any product that is habit-forming and you’ll see that
        it does not create a new motivation, but rather latches onto the
        underlying motives of human nature.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Find love and reproduce = using Tinder</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Connect and bond with others = browsing Facebook</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><span id="19_10_How_to_Find_and_Fi.xhtml#page_128" class="pagebreak" title="128"></span>Win social
            acceptance and approval
            = posting on Instagram</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Reduce uncertainty = searching on Google</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Achieve status and prestige = playing video games</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Your habits are modern-day solutions to ancient desires. New versions
        of old vices. The underlying motives behind human behavior remain the
        same. The specific habits we perform differ based on the period of
        history.</p>
      <p>Here’s the powerful part: there are many different ways to address
        the same underlying motive. One person might learn to reduce stress by
        smoking a cigarette. Another person learns to ease their anxiety by
        going for a run. Your current habits are not necessarily the best way to
        solve the problems you face; they are just the methods you learned to
        use. Once you associate a solution with the problem you need to solve,
        you keep coming back to it.</p>
      <p>Habits are all about associations. These associations determine
        whether we predict a habit to be worth repeating or not. As we covered
        in our discussion of the 1st Law, your brain is continually absorbing
        information and noticing cues in the environment. Every time you
        perceive a cue, your brain runs a simulation and makes a prediction
        about what to do in the next moment.</p>
      <p>Cue: You notice that the stove is hot.</p>
      <p>Prediction: <em>If I touch it I’ll get burned, so I should avoid
          touching it.</em></p>
      <p>Cue: You see that the traffic light turned green.</p>
      <p>Prediction: <em>If I step on the gas, I’ll make it safely through the
          intersection and get closer to my destination, so I should step on the
          gas.</em></p>
      <p>You see a cue, categorize it based on past experience, and determine
        the appropriate response.</p>
      <p><span id="19_10_How_to_Find_and_Fi.xhtml#page_129" class="pagebreak" title="129"></span>This all happens in an
        instant, but it plays a
        crucial role in your habits because every action is preceded by a
        prediction. Life feels reactive, but it is actually predictive. All day
        long, you are making your best guess of how to act given what you’ve
        just seen and what has worked for you in the past. You are endlessly
        predicting what will happen in the next moment.</p>
      <p>Our behavior is heavily dependent on these predictions. Put another
        way, our behavior is heavily dependent on how we interpret the events
        that happen to us, not necessarily the objective reality of the events
        themselves. Two people can look at the same cigarette, and one feels the
        urge to smoke while the other is repulsed by the smell. The same cue can
        spark a good habit or a bad habit depending on your prediction. The
        cause of your habits is actually the prediction that precedes them.</p>
      <p>These predictions lead to feelings, which is how we typically
        describe a craving—a feeling, a desire, an urge. Feelings and emotions
        transform the cues we perceive and the predictions we make into a signal
        that we can apply. They help explain what we are currently sensing. For
        instance, whether or not you realize it, you are noticing how warm or
        cold you feel right now. If the temperature drops by one degree, you
        probably won’t do anything. If the temperature drops ten degrees,
        however, you’ll feel cold and put on another layer of clothing. Feeling
        cold was the signal that prompted you to act. You have been sensing the
        cues the entire time, but it is only when you predict that you would be
        better off in a different state that you take action.</p>
      <p>A craving is the sense that something is missing. It is the desire to
        change your internal state. When the temperature falls, there is a gap
        between what your body is currently sensing and what it <em>wants</em>
        to be sensing. This gap between your current state and your desired
        state provides a reason to act.</p>
      <p>Desire is the difference between where you are now and where you
        <span id="19_10_How_to_Find_and_Fi.xhtml#page_130" class="pagebreak" title="130"></span>want to be in the
        future. Even the tiniest action is
        tinged with the motivation to feel differently than you do in the
        moment. When you binge-eat or light up or browse social media, what you
        really want is <em>not</em> a potato chip or a cigarette or a bunch of
        likes. What you really want is to <em>feel</em> different.
      </p>
      <p>Our feelings and emotions tell us whether to hold steady in our
        current state or to make a change. They help us decide the best course
        of action. Neurologists have discovered that <span
          id="19_10_How_to_Find_and_Fi.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText128"></span>when
        emotions and feelings are impaired, we actually lose the ability to make
        decisions. We have no signal of what to pursue and what to avoid. <span
          id="19_10_How_to_Find_and_Fi.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText129"></span>As the
        neuroscientist Antonio Damasio explains, “It is emotion that allows you
        to mark things as good, bad, or indifferent.”</p>
      <p>To summarize, the specific cravings you feel and habits you perform
        are really an attempt to address your fundamental underlying motives.
        Whenever a habit successfully addresses a motive, you develop a craving
        to do it again. In time, you learn to predict that checking social media
        will help you feel loved or that watching YouTube will allow you to
        forget your fears. Habits are attractive when we associate them with
        positive feelings, and we can use this insight to our advantage rather
        than to our detriment.</p>
      <h3 class="x05-Head-A">HOW TO REPROGRAM YOUR BRAIN TO ENJOY HARD
        HABITS</h3>
      <p>You can make hard habits more attractive if you can learn to
        associate them with a positive experience. Sometimes, all you need is a
        slight mind-set shift. For instance, we often talk about everything we
        have to do in a given day. You have to wake up early for work. You have
        to make another sales call for your business. You have to cook dinner
        for your family.</p>
      <p><span id="19_10_How_to_Find_and_Fi.xhtml#page_131" class="pagebreak" title="131"></span>Now, imagine changing
        just one word: <span id="19_10_How_to_Find_and_Fi.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText130"></span>You
        don’t “have” to. You “get” to.</p>
      <p>You <em>get</em> to wake up early for work. You <em>get</em> to make
        another sales call for your business. You <em>get</em> to cook dinner
        for your family. By simply changing one word, you shift the way you view
        each event. You transition from seeing these behaviors as burdens and
        turn them into opportunities.</p>
      <p>The key point is that both versions of reality are true. You
        <em>have</em> to do those things, and you also <em>get</em> to do them.
        We can find evidence for whatever mind-set we choose.
      </p>
      <p>I once heard a story about a man who uses a wheelchair. When asked if
        it was difficult being confined, he responded, “<span
          id="19_10_How_to_Find_and_Fi.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText131"></span>I’m
        not confined to my wheelchair—I am liberated by it. If it wasn’t for my
        wheelchair, I would be bed-bound and never able to leave my house.” This
        shift in perspective completely transformed how he lived each day.</p>
      <p>Reframing your habits to highlight their <em>benefits</em> rather
        than their drawbacks is a fast and lightweight way to reprogram your
        mind and make a habit seem more attractive.</p>
      <p><strong>Exercise.</strong> Many people associate exercise with being
        a challenging task that drains energy and wears you down. You can just
        as easily view it as a way to develop skills and build you up. Instead
        of telling yourself “I need to go run in the morning,” say “<span
          id="19_10_How_to_Find_and_Fi.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText132"></span>It’s
        time to build endurance and get fast.”</p>
      <p><strong>Finance.</strong> Saving money is often associated with
        sacrifice. However, you can associate it with freedom rather than
        limitation if you realize one simple truth: living below your current
        means <em>increases</em> your future means. The money you save this
        month increases your purchasing power next month.</p>
      <p><strong>Meditation.</strong> Anyone who has tried meditation for more
        than three seconds knows how frustrating it can be when the next
        distraction <span id="19_10_How_to_Find_and_Fi.xhtml#page_132" class="pagebreak" title="132"></span>inevitably
        pops into your mind. You
        can transform frustration into delight when you realize that each
        interruption gives you a chance to practice returning to your breath.
        Distraction is a good thing because you need distractions to practice
        meditation.</p>
      <p><strong>Pregame jitters.</strong> Many people feel anxious before
        delivering a big presentation or competing in an important event. They
        experience quicker breathing, a faster heart rate, heightened arousal.
        If we interpret these feelings negatively, then we feel threatened and
        tense up. If we interpret these feelings positively, then we can respond
        with fluidity and grace. You can reframe “I am nervous” to “I am excited
        and <span id="19_10_How_to_Find_and_Fi.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText133"></span>I’m
        getting an adrenaline rush to help me concentrate.”</p>
      <p>These little mind-set shifts aren’t magic, but they can help change
        the feelings you associate with a particular habit or situation.</p>
      <p>If you want to take it a step further, you can create a
        <em>motivation ritual</em>. You simply practice associating your habits
        with something you enjoy, then you can use that cue whenever you need a
        bit of motivation. For instance, if you always play the same song before
        having sex, then you’ll begin to link the music with the act. Whenever
        you want to get in the mood, just press play.
      </p>
      <p><span id="19_10_How_to_Find_and_Fi.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText134"></span>Ed
        Latimore, a boxer and writer from Pittsburgh, benefited from a similar
        strategy without knowing it. “Odd realization,” he wrote. “My focus and
        concentration goes up just by putting my headphones [on] while writing.
        I don’t even have to play any music.” Without realizing it, he was
        conditioning himself. In the beginning, he put his headphones on, played
        some music he enjoyed, and did focused work. After doing it five, ten,
        twenty times, putting his headphones on became a cue that he
        automatically associated with increased focus. The craving followed
        naturally.</p>
      <p>Athletes use similar strategies to get themselves in the mind-set to
        perform. During my baseball career, I developed a specific ritual of
        stretching and throwing before each game. The whole sequence took about
        ten minutes, and I did it the same way every single time. While <span
          id="19_10_How_to_Find_and_Fi.xhtml#page_133" class="pagebreak" title="133"></span>it physically warmed me up
        to play, more importantly,
        it put me in the right mental state. I began to associate my pregame
        ritual with feeling competitive and focused. Even if I wasn’t motivated
        beforehand, by the time I was done with my ritual, I was in “game
        mode.”</p>
      <p>You can adapt this strategy for nearly any purpose. Say you want to
        feel happier in general. Find something that makes you truly happy—like
        petting your dog or taking a bubble bath—and then create a short routine
        that you perform every time <em>before</em> you do the thing you love.
        Maybe you take three deep breaths and smile.</p>
      <p>Three deep breaths. Smile. Pet the dog. Repeat.</p>
      <p>Eventually, you’ll begin to associate this breathe-and-smile routine
        with being in a good mood. It becomes a cue that <em>means</em> feeling
        happy. Once established, you can break it out anytime you need to change
        your emotional state. Stressed at work? Take three deep breaths and
        smile. Sad about life? Three deep breaths and smile. Once a habit has
        been built, the cue can prompt a craving, even if it has little to do
        with the original situation.</p>
      <p>The key to finding and fixing the causes of your bad habits is to
        reframe the associations you have about them. It’s not easy, but if you
        can reprogram your predictions, you can transform a hard habit into an
        attractive one.</p>

      <p>O<span class="RunIn">N THE FIRST </span>day of class, Jerry Uelsmann,
        a professor at the University of Florida, divided his film photography
        students into two groups.</p>
      <p>Everyone on the left side of the classroom, he explained, would be in
        the “quantity” group. They would be graded solely on the amount of work
        they produced. On the final day of class, he would tally the number of
        photos submitted by each student. One hundred photos would rate an A,
        ninety photos a B, eighty photos a C, and so on.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, everyone on the right side of the room would be in the
        “quality” group. They would be graded only on the excellence of their
        work. They would only need to produce one photo during the semester, but
        to get an A, it had to be a nearly perfect image.</p>
      <p>At the end of the term, he was surprised to find that all the best
        photos were produced by the <em>quantity</em> group. During the
        semester, these students were busy taking photos, experimenting with
        composition and lighting, testing out various methods in the darkroom,
        and learning from their mistakes. In the process of creating hundreds of
        photos, they honed their skills. Meanwhile, the <em>quality</em> group
        sat <span id="21_11_Walk_Slowly_but_Ne.xhtml#page_142" class="pagebreak" title="142"></span>around speculating
        about perfection. <span id="21_11_Walk_Slowly_but_Ne.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText135"></span>In the
        end, they had little to show for their efforts other than unverified
        theories and one mediocre photo.<span id="21_11_Walk_Slowly_but_Ne.xhtml#footnote-015-backlink"><a
            href="57_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_1" class="_idFootnoteLink noteref" role="doc-noteref">*</a></span></p>
      <p>It is easy to get bogged down trying to find the optimal plan for
        change: the fastest way to lose weight, the best program to build
        muscle, the perfect idea for a side hustle. We are so focused on
        figuring out the best approach that we never get around to taking
        action. <span id="21_11_Walk_Slowly_but_Ne.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText136"></span>As
        Voltaire once wrote, “The best is the enemy of the good.”</p>
      <p>I refer to this as the difference between being in motion and taking
        action. The two ideas sound similar, but they’re not the same. When
        you’re in motion, you’re planning and strategizing and learning. Those
        are all good things, but they don’t produce a result.</p>
      <p>Action, on the other hand, is the type of behavior that will deliver
        an outcome. If I outline twenty ideas for articles I want to write,
        that’s motion. If I actually sit down and write an article, that’s
        action. If I search for a better diet plan and read a few books on the
        topic, that’s motion. If I actually eat a healthy meal, that’s
        action.</p>
      <p>Sometimes motion is useful, but it will never produce an outcome by
        itself. It doesn’t matter how many times you go talk to the personal
        trainer, that motion will never get you in shape. Only the action of
        working out will get the result you’re looking to achieve.</p>
      <p>If motion doesn’t lead to results, why do we do it? Sometimes we do
        it because we actually need to plan or learn more. But more often than
        not, we do it because motion allows us to feel like we’re making
        progress without running the risk of failure. Most of us are experts at
        avoiding criticism. It doesn’t feel good to fail or to be judged
        publicly, so we tend to avoid situations where that might happen. And
        that’s the biggest reason why you slip into motion rather than taking
        action: you want to delay failure.</p>
      <p><span id="21_11_Walk_Slowly_but_Ne.xhtml#page_143" class="pagebreak" title="143"></span>It’s easy to be in
        motion and convince yourself that
        you’re still making progress. You think, <em>“I’ve got conversations
          going with four potential clients right now. This is good. We’re moving
          in the right direction.”</em> Or, <em>“I brainstormed some ideas for
          that book I want to write. This is coming together.”</em></p>
      <p>Motion makes you feel like you’re getting things done. But really,
        you’re just preparing to get something done. When preparation becomes a
        form of procrastination, you need to change something. You don’t want to
        merely be planning. You want to be practicing.</p>
      <p>If you want to master a habit, the key is to start with repetition,
        not perfection. You don’t need to map out every feature of a new habit.
        You just need to practice it. This is the first takeaway of the 3rd Law:
        you just need to get your reps in.</p>
      <h3 class="x05-Head-A">HOW LONG DOES IT ACTUALLY TAKE TO FORM A NEW
        HABIT?</h3>
      <p>Habit formation is the process by which a behavior becomes
        progressively more automatic through repetition. The more you repeat an
        activity, the more the structure of your brain changes to become
        efficient at that activity. Neuroscientists call this <em><span
            id="21_11_Walk_Slowly_but_Ne.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText137"></span>long-term
          potentiation</em>, which refers to the strengthening of connections
        between neurons in the brain based on recent patterns of activity. With
        each repetition, cell-to-cell signaling improves and the neural
        connections tighten. First described by neuropsychologist Donald Hebb in
        1949, this phenomenon is commonly known as Hebb’s Law: “<span
          id="21_11_Walk_Slowly_but_Ne.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText138"></span>Neurons
        that fire together wire together.”</p>
      <p>Repeating a habit leads to clear physical changes in the brain. <span
          id="21_11_Walk_Slowly_but_Ne.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText139"></span>In
        musicians, the cerebellum—critical for physical movements like plucking
        a guitar string or pulling a violin bow—is larger than it is in
        nonmusicians. <span id="21_11_Walk_Slowly_but_Ne.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText140"></span>Mathematicians,
        meanwhile, have increased gray matter in <span id="21_11_Walk_Slowly_but_Ne.xhtml#page_144" class="pagebreak"
          title="144"></span>the inferior parietal lobule, which plays a key role
        in computation and calculation. Its size is directly correlated with the
        amount of time spent in the field; the older and more experienced the
        mathematician, the greater the increase in gray matter.</p>
      <p><span id="21_11_Walk_Slowly_but_Ne.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText141"></span>When
        scientists analyzed the brains of taxi drivers in London, they found
        that the hippocampus—a region of the brain involved in spatial
        memory—was significantly larger in their subjects than in non–taxi
        drivers. Even more fascinating, the hippocampus decreased in size when a
        driver retired. Like the muscles of the body responding to regular
        weight training, particular regions of the brain adapt as they are used
        and atrophy as they are abandoned.</p>
      <p>Of course, the importance of repetition in establishing habits was
        recognized long before neuroscientists began poking around. In 1860, the
        English philosopher George H. Lewes noted, “In learning to speak a new
        language, to play on a musical instrument, or to perform unaccustomed
        movements, great difficulty is felt, because the channels through which
        each sensation has to pass have not become established; but no sooner
        has frequent repetition cut a pathway, than this difficulty vanishes;
        <span id="21_11_Walk_Slowly_but_Ne.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText142"></span>the
        actions become so automatic that they can be performed while the mind is
        otherwise engaged.” Both common sense and scientific evidence agree:
        <span id="21_11_Walk_Slowly_but_Ne.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText143"></span>repetition
        is a form of change.
      </p>
      <p>Each time you repeat an action, you are activating a particular
        neural circuit associated with that habit. This means that simply
        putting in your reps is one of the most critical steps you can take to
        encoding a new habit. It is why the students who took tons of photos
        improved their skills while those who merely theorized about perfect
        photos did not. One group engaged in active practice, the other in
        passive learning. One in action, the other in motion.</p>
      <p>All habits follow a similar trajectory from effortful practice to
        automatic behavior, a process known as <em>automaticity</em>. <span
          id="21_11_Walk_Slowly_but_Ne.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText144"></span>Automaticity
        is the ability to perform a behavior without thinking about each step,
        which occurs when the nonconscious mind takes over.</p>
      <p>It looks something like this:</p>
      <h3 class="x05-Head-A">THE HABIT LINE</h3>

        <figcaption aria-hidden="true"><span class="Figure"><span id="21_11_Walk_Slowly_but_Ne.xhtml#page_145"

      <p>On the following page, you’ll see what it looks like when researchers
        track the level of automaticity for an actual habit like walking for ten
        minutes each day. The shape of these charts, which scientists call
        <em>learning curves</em>, reveals an important truth about behavior
        change: <span id="21_11_Walk_Slowly_but_Ne.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText145"></span>habits
        form based on frequency, not time.

      <p><span id="21_11_Walk_Slowly_but_Ne.xhtml#page_146" class="pagebreak" title="146"></span>One of the most common
        questions I hear is, “How
        <em>long</em> does it take to build a new habit?” But what people really
        should be asking is, “How <em>many</em> does it take to form a new
        habit?” That is, how many repetitions are required to make a habit
        automatic?
      </p>
      <p>There is nothing magical about time passing with regard to habit
        formation. It doesn’t matter if it’s been twenty-one days or thirty days
        or three hundred days. What matters is the rate at which you perform the
        behavior. You could do something twice in thirty days, or two hundred
        times. It’s the frequency that makes the difference. Your current habits
        have been internalized over the course of hundreds, if not thousands, of
        repetitions. New habits require the same level of <span id="21_11_Walk_Slowly_but_Ne.xhtml#page_147"
          class="pagebreak" title="147"></span>frequency. You need to string together enough
        successful attempts until the behavior is firmly embedded in your mind
        and you cross the Habit Line.</p>
      <p>In practice, it doesn’t really matter how long it takes for a habit
        to become automatic. What matters is that you take the actions you need
        to take to make progress. Whether an action is fully automatic is of
        less importance.</p>
      <p>To build a habit, you need to practice it. And the most effective way
        to make practice happen is to adhere to the 3rd Law of Behavior Change:
        <em>make it easy</em>. The chapters that follow will show you how to do
        exactly that.

        <em>Guns, Germs, and Steel</em>, anthropologist and biologist Jared
        Diamond points out a simple fact: different continents have different
        shapes. At first glance, this statement seems rather obvious and
        unimportant, but it turns out to have a profound impact on human
        behavior.
      </p>
      <p>The primary axis of the Americas runs from north to south. That is,
        the landmass of North and South America tends to be tall and thin rather
        than wide and fat. The same is generally true for Africa. Meanwhile, the
        landmass that makes up Europe, Asia, and the Middle East is the
        opposite. This massive stretch of land tends to be more east-west in
        shape. According to Diamond, <span id="22_12_The_Law_of_Least_E.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText146"></span>this
        difference in shape played a significant role in the spread of
        agriculture over the centuries.</p>
      <p>When agriculture began to spread around the globe, farmers had an
        easier time expanding along east-west routes than along north-south
        ones. This is because locations along the same latitude generally share
        similar climates, amounts of sunlight and rainfall, and changes in
        season. These factors allowed farmers in Europe and Asia to domesticate
        a few crops and grow them along the entire stretch of land from France
        to China.</p>
      <h3 class="x05-Head-A">THE SHAPE OF HUMAN BEHAVIOR</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="./image/Fig12_071218.jpg" class="w100"
          alt="FIGURE 13: The primary axis of Europe and Asia is east-west. The primary axis of the Americas and Africa is north-south. This leads to a wider range of climates up-and-down the Americas than across Europe and Asia. As a result, agriculture spread nearly twice as fast across Europe and Asia than it did elsewhere. The behavior of farmers—even across hundreds or thousands of years—was constrained by the amount of friction in the environment." />
        <figcaption aria-hidden="true"><span class="Figure"><span id="22_12_The_Law_of_Least_E.xhtml#page_150"
              class="pagebreak" title="150"></span>FIGURE 13:</span> The primary axis of Europe and Asia
          is east-west. The primary axis of the Americas and Africa is
          north-south. This leads to a wider range of climates up-and-down the
          Americas than across Europe and Asia. As a result, agriculture spread
          nearly twice as fast across Europe and Asia than it did elsewhere. The
          behavior of farmers—even across hundreds or thousands of years—was
          constrained by the amount of friction in the environment.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>By comparison, the climate varies greatly when traveling from north
        to south. Just imagine how different the weather is in Florida compared
        to Canada. You can be the most talented farmer in the world, but it
        won’t help you grow Florida oranges in the Canadian <span id="22_12_The_Law_of_Least_E.xhtml#page_151"
          class="pagebreak" title="151"></span>winter. Snow is a poor substitute for soil. In order
        to spread crops along north-south routes, farmers would need to find and
        domesticate new plants whenever the climate changed.</p>
      <p>As a result, agriculture spread two to three times faster across Asia
        and Europe than it did up and down the Americas. Over the span of
        centuries, this small difference had a very big impact. Increased food
        production allowed for more rapid population growth. With more people,
        these cultures were able to build stronger armies and were better
        equipped to develop new technologies. The changes started out small—a
        crop that spread slightly farther, a population that grew slightly
        faster—but compounded into substantial differences over time.</p>
      <p>The spread of agriculture provides an example of the 3rd Law of
        Behavior Change on a global scale. Conventional wisdom holds that
        motivation is the key to habit change. Maybe if you <em>really</em>
        wanted it, you’d actually do it. But the truth is, our real motivation
        is to be lazy and to do what is convenient. And despite what the latest
        productivity best seller will tell you, this is a smart strategy, not a
        dumb one.</p>
      <p>Energy is precious, and the brain is wired to conserve it whenever
        possible. <span id="22_12_The_Law_of_Least_E.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText147"></span>It is
        human nature to follow the Law of Least Effort, which states that when
        deciding between two similar options, people will naturally gravitate
        toward the option that requires the least amount of work.<span
          id="22_12_The_Law_of_Least_E.xhtml#footnote-017-backlink"><a href="58_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_1"
            class="_idFootnoteLink noteref" role="doc-noteref">*</a></span> For example, expanding your farm to the
        east where you can grow the same crops rather than heading north where
        the climate is different. Out of all the possible actions we could take,
        the one that is realized is the one that delivers the most value for the
        least effort. We are motivated to do what is easy.</p>
      <p><span id="22_12_The_Law_of_Least_E.xhtml#page_152" class="pagebreak" title="152"></span>Every action requires a
        certain amount of energy. The
        more energy required, the less likely it is to occur. If your goal is to
        do a hundred push-ups per day, that’s a lot of energy! In the beginning,
        when you’re motivated and excited, you can muster the strength to get
        started. But after a few days, such a massive effort feels exhausting.
        Meanwhile, sticking to the habit of doing one push-up per day requires
        almost no energy to get started. And the less energy a habit requires,
        the more likely it is to occur.</p>
      <p>Look at any behavior that fills up much of your life and you’ll see
        that it can be performed with very low levels of motivation. Habits like
        scrolling on our phones, checking email, and watching television steal
        so much of our time because they can be performed almost without effort.
        They are remarkably convenient.</p>
      <p>In a sense, every habit is just an obstacle to getting what you
        really want. Dieting is an obstacle to getting fit. Meditation is an
        obstacle to feeling calm. Journaling is an obstacle to thinking clearly.
        You don’t actually want the habit itself. What you really want is the
        outcome the habit delivers. The greater the obstacle—that is, the more
        difficult the habit—the more friction there is between you and your
        desired end state. This is why it is crucial to make your habits so easy
        that you’ll do them even when you don’t feel like it. If you can make
        your good habits more convenient, you’ll be more likely to follow
        through on them.</p>
      <p>But what about all the moments when we seem to do the opposite? If
        we’re all so lazy, then how do you explain people accomplishing hard
        things like raising a child or starting a business or climbing Mount
        Everest?</p>
      <p>Certainly, you are capable of doing very hard things. The problem is
        that some days you feel like doing the hard work and some days you feel
        like giving in. On the tough days, it’s crucial to have as many things
        working in your favor as possible so that you can overcome the
        challenges life naturally throws your way. The less friction you face,
        the <span id="22_12_The_Law_of_Least_E.xhtml#page_153" class="pagebreak" title="153"></span>easier it is for
        your stronger self to emerge. The
        idea behind <em>make it easy</em> is not to <em>only</em> do easy
        things. The idea is to make it as easy as possible in the moment to do
        things that payoff in the long run.</p>
      <h3 class="x05-Head-A">HOW TO ACHIEVE MORE WITH LESS EFFORT</h3>
      <p>Imagine you are holding <span id="22_12_The_Law_of_Least_E.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText148"></span>a
        garden hose that is bent in the middle. Some water can flow through, but
        not very much. If you want to increase the rate at which water passes
        through the hose, you have two options. The first option is to crank up
        the valve and force more water out. The second option is to simply
        remove the bend in the hose and let water flow through naturally.</p>
      <p>Trying to pump up your motivation to stick with a hard habit is like
        trying to force water through a bent hose. You can do it, but it
        requires a lot of effort and increases the tension in your life.
        Meanwhile, making your habits simple and easy is like removing the bend
        in the hose. Rather than trying to overcome the friction in your life,
        you reduce it.</p>
      <p>One of the most effective ways to reduce the friction associated with
        your habits is to practice environment design. In Chapter 6, we
        discussed environment design as a method for making cues more obvious,
        but you can also optimize your environment to make actions easier. For
        example, when deciding where to practice a new habit, it is best to
        choose a place that is already along the path of your daily routine.
        Habits are easier to build when they fit into the flow of your life. You
        are more likely to go to the gym if it is on your way to work because
        stopping doesn’t add much friction to your lifestyle. By comparison, if
        the gym is off the path of your normal commute—even by just a few
        blocks—now you’re going “out of your way” to get there.</p>
      <p>Perhaps even more effective is reducing the friction within your home
        or office. Too often, we try to start habits in high-friction
        environments. We try to follow a strict diet while we are out to dinner
        with <span id="22_12_The_Law_of_Least_E.xhtml#page_154" class="pagebreak" title="154"></span>friends. We try to
        write a book in
        a chaotic household. We try to concentrate while using a smartphone
        filled with distractions. It doesn’t have to be this way. We can remove
        the points of friction that hold us back. This is precisely what
        electronics manufacturers in Japan began to do in the 1970s.</p>
      <p>In an article published in the <em>New Yorker</em> titled “Better All
        the Time,” James Suroweicki writes:</p>
      <p>“Japanese firms emphasized what came to be known as ‘lean
        production,’ relentlessly looking to remove waste of all kinds from the
        production process, down to redesigning workspaces, so workers didn’t
        have to waste time twisting and turning to reach their tools. The result
        was that Japanese factories were more efficient and Japanese products
        were more reliable than American ones. In 1974, service calls for
        American-made color televisions were five times as common as for
        Japanese televisions. By 1979, <span id="22_12_The_Law_of_Least_E.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText149"></span>it
        took American workers three times as long to assemble their sets.”</p>
      <p>I like to refer to this strategy as <span
          id="22_12_The_Law_of_Least_E.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText150"></span><em>addition
          by subtraction</em>.<span id="22_12_The_Law_of_Least_E.xhtml#footnote-016-backlink"><a
            href="59_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_2" class="_idFootnoteLink noteref" role="doc-noteref">*</a></span> The
        Japanese companies looked for every
        point of friction in the manufacturing process and eliminated it. As
        they subtracted wasted effort, they added customers and revenue.
        Similarly, when we remove the points of friction that sap our time and
        energy, we can achieve more with less effort. (This is one reason
        tidying up can feel so good: we are simultaneously moving forward and
        lightening the cognitive load our environment places on us.)</p>
      <p>If you look at the most habit-forming products, you’ll notice that
        one of the things these goods and services do best is remove little bits
        of friction from your life. Meal delivery services reduce the friction
        of shopping for groceries. Dating apps reduce the friction of making
        <span id="22_12_The_Law_of_Least_E.xhtml#page_155" class="pagebreak" title="155"></span>social introductions.
        Ride-sharing services reduce
        the friction of getting across town. Text messaging reduces the friction
        of sending a letter in the mail.
      </p>
      <p>Like a Japanese television manufacturer redesigning their workspace
        to reduce wasted motion, successful companies design their products to
        automate, eliminate, or simplify as many steps as possible. They reduce
        the number of fields on each form. They pare down the number of clicks
        required to create an account. They deliver their products with
        easy-to-understand directions or ask their customers to make fewer
        choices.</p>
      <p>When the first voice-activated speakers were released—products like
        Google Home, Amazon Echo, and Apple HomePod—I asked a friend what he
        liked about the product he had purchased. He said it was just easier to
        say “Play some country music” than to pull out his phone, open the music
        app, and pick a playlist. Of course, just a few years earlier, having
        unlimited access to music in your pocket was a remarkably frictionless
        behavior compared to driving to the store and buying a CD. Business is a
        never-ending quest to deliver the same result in an easier fashion.</p>
      <p>Similar strategies have been used effectively by governments. When
        the British government wanted to increase tax collection rates, they
        switched from sending citizens to a web page where the tax form could be
        downloaded to linking directly to the form. Reducing that one step in
        the process increased the response rate from 19.2 percent to 23.4
        percent. For a country like the United Kingdom, <span
          id="22_12_The_Law_of_Least_E.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText151"></span>those
        percentage points represent millions in tax revenue.</p>
      <p>The central idea is to create an environment where doing the right
        thing is as easy as possible. Much of the battle of building better
        habits comes down to finding ways to reduce the friction associated with
        our good habits and increase the friction associated with our bad
        ones.</p>

          title="156"></span>PRIME THE ENVIRONMENT FOR FUTURE USE</h3>
      <p>Oswald Nuckols is an IT developer from Natchez, Mississippi. He is
        also someone who understands the power of priming his environment.</p>
      <p><span id="22_12_The_Law_of_Least_E.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText152"></span>Nuckols
        dialed in his cleaning habits by following a strategy he refers to as
        “resetting the room.” For instance, when he finishes watching
        television, he places the remote back on the TV stand, arranges the
        pillows on the couch, and folds the blanket. When he leaves his car, he
        throws any trash away. Whenever he takes a shower, he wipes down the
        toilet while the shower is warming up. (As he notes, the “<span
          id="22_12_The_Law_of_Least_E.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText153"></span>perfect
        time to clean the toilet is right before you wash yourself in the shower
        anyway.”) The purpose of resetting each room is not simply to clean up
        after the last action, but to prepare for the next action.</p>
      <p>“When I walk into a room everything is in its right place,” Nuckols
        wrote. “Because I do this every day in every room, stuff always stays in
        good shape. . . . People think I work hard but I’m actually really lazy.
        I’m just proactively lazy. It gives you so much time back.”</p>
      <p>Whenever you organize a space for its intended purpose, you are
        priming it to make the next action easy. For instance, my wife keeps a
        box of greeting cards that are presorted by occasion—birthday, sympathy,
        wedding, graduation, and more. Whenever necessary, she grabs an
        appropriate card and sends it off. She is incredibly good at remembering
        to send cards because she has reduced the friction of doing so. For
        years, I was the opposite. Someone would have a baby and I would think,
        “I should send a card.” But then weeks would pass and by the time I
        remembered to pick one up at the store, it was too late. The habit
        wasn’t easy.</p>
      <p>There are many ways to prime your environment so it’s ready for
        immediate use. If you want to cook a healthy breakfast, place the
        skillet on the stove, set the cooking spray on the counter, and lay out
        any plates and utensils you’ll need the night before. When you wake up,
        making breakfast will be easy.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><span id="22_12_The_Law_of_Least_E.xhtml#page_157" class="pagebreak" title="157"></span>Want to draw more?
            Put your
            pencils, pens, notebooks, and drawing tools on top of your desk, within
            easy reach.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Want to exercise? Set out your workout clothes, shoes, gym bag,
            and water bottle ahead of time.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Want to improve your diet? Chop up a ton of fruits and vegetables
            on weekends and pack them in containers, so you have easy access to
            healthy, ready-to-eat options during the week.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>These are simple ways to make the good habit the path of least
        resistance.</p>
      <p>You can also invert this principle and prime the environment to make
        bad behaviors difficult. If you find yourself watching too much
        television, for example, then unplug it after each use. Only plug it
        back in if you can say out loud the name of the show you want to watch.
        This setup creates just enough friction to prevent mindless viewing.</p>
      <p>If that doesn’t do it, you can take it a step further. Unplug the
        television and take the batteries out of the remote after each use, so
        it takes an extra ten seconds to turn it back on. And if you’re really
        hard-core, move the television out of the living room and into a closet
        after each use. You can be sure you’ll only take it out when you
        <em>really</em> want to watch something. The greater the friction, the
        less likely the habit.
      </p>
      <p>Whenever possible, I leave my phone in a different room until lunch.
        When it’s right next to me, I’ll check it all morning for no reason at
        all. But when it is in another room, I rarely think about it. And the
        friction is high enough that I won’t go get it without a reason. As a
        result, I get three to four hours each morning when I can work without
        interruption.</p>
      <p>If sticking your phone in another room doesn’t seem like enough, tell
        a friend or family member to hide it from you for a few hours. Ask a
        coworker to keep it at their desk in the morning and give it back to you
        at lunch.</p>
      <p><span id="22_12_The_Law_of_Least_E.xhtml#page_158" class="pagebreak" title="158"></span>It is remarkable how
        little friction is required to
        prevent unwanted behavior. When I hide beer in the back of the fridge
        where I can’t see it, I drink less. When I delete social media apps from
        my phone, it can be weeks before I download them again and log in. These
        tricks are unlikely to curb a true addiction, but for many of us, a
        little bit of friction can be the difference between sticking with a
        good habit or sliding into a bad one. Imagine the cumulative impact of
        making dozens of these changes and living in an environment designed to
        make the good behaviors easier and the bad behaviors harder.</p>
      <p>Whether we are approaching behavior change as an individual, a
        parent, a coach, or a leader, we should ask ourselves the same question:
        “How can we design a world where it’s easy to do what’s right?” Redesign
        your life so the actions that matter most are also the actions that are
        easiest to do.</p>

      <p>T<span class="RunIn">WYLA</span> T<span class="RunIn">HARP</span>
        <span class="RunIn">IS</span> widely regarded as one of the greatest
        dancers and choreographers of the modern era. In 1992, she was awarded a
        MacArthur Fellowship, often referred to as the Genius Grant, and she has
        spent the bulk of her career touring the globe to perform her original
        works. She also credits much of her success to simple daily habits.
      </p>
      <p>“I begin each day of my life with a ritual,” she writes. “I wake up
        at 5:30 A.M., put on my workout clothes, my leg warmers, my sweat shirt,
        and my hat. I walk outside my Manhattan home, hail a taxi, and tell the
        driver to take me to the Pumping Iron gym at 91st Street and First
        Avenue, where I work out for two hours.</p>
      <p>“The ritual is not the stretching and weight training I put my body
        through each morning at the gym; the ritual is the cab. The moment I
        tell the driver where to go I have completed the ritual.</p>
      <p>“It’s a simple act, but doing it the same way each morning
        habitualizes it—makes it repeatable, easy to do. It reduces the chance
        that I would skip it or do it differently. It is one more item in my
        <span id="23_13_How_to_Stop_Procra.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText154"></span>arsenal
        of routines, and one less thing to think about.”
      </p>
      <p><span id="23_13_How_to_Stop_Procra.xhtml#page_160" class="pagebreak" title="160"></span>Hailing a cab each
        morning may be a tiny action, but
        it is a splendid example of the 3rd Law of Behavior Change.</p>
      <p>Researchers estimate that <span id="23_13_How_to_Stop_Procra.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText155"></span>40 to
        50 percent of our actions on any given day are done out of habit. This
        is already a substantial percentage, but the true influence of your
        habits is even greater than these numbers suggest. Habits are automatic
        choices that influence the conscious decisions that follow. Yes, a habit
        can be completed in just a few seconds, but it can also shape the
        actions that you take for minutes or hours afterward.</p>
      <p>Habits are like the entrance ramp to a highway. They lead you down a
        path and, before you know it, you’re speeding toward the next behavior.
        It seems to be easier to continue what you are already doing than to
        start doing something different. You sit through a bad movie for two
        hours. You keep snacking even when you’re already full. You check your
        phone for “just a second” and soon you have spent twenty minutes staring
        at the screen. In this way, the <span id="23_13_How_to_Stop_Procra.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText156"></span>habits
        you follow without thinking often determine the choices you make when
        you are thinking.</p>
      <p>Each evening, there is a tiny moment—usually around 5:15 p.m.—that
        shapes the rest of my night. My wife walks in the door from work and
        either we change into our workout clothes and head to the gym or we
        crash onto the couch, order Indian food, and watch <em>The
          Office</em>.<span id="23_13_How_to_Stop_Procra.xhtml#footnote-019-backlink"><a
            href="60_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_1" class="_idFootnoteLink noteref" role="doc-noteref">*</a></span> Similar
        to Twyla Tharp hailing the cab,
        the ritual is changing into my workout clothes. If I change clothes, I
        know the workout will happen. Everything that follows—driving to the
        gym, deciding which exercises to do, stepping under the bar—is easy once
        I’ve taken the first step.</p>
      <p>Every day, there are a handful of moments that deliver an outsized
        impact. I refer to these little choices as <span
          id="23_13_How_to_Stop_Procra.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText157"></span><em>decisive
          moments</em>. The moment you decide between ordering takeout or cooking
        dinner. The moment you choose between driving your car or riding your
        bike. The moment you decide between starting your homework or grabbing
        the video game controller. These choices are a fork in the road.</p>

          The difference between a good day and a bad day is often a few
          productive and healthy choices made at decisive moments. Each one is
          like a fork in the road, and these choices stack up throughout the day
          and can ultimately lead to very different outcomes.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Decisive moments set the options available to your future self. For
        <span id="23_13_How_to_Stop_Procra.xhtml#page_162" class="pagebreak" title="162"></span>instance, walking into a
        restaurant is a decisive
        moment because it determines what you’ll be eating for lunch.
        Technically, you are in control of what you order, but in a larger
        sense, you can only order an item if it is on the menu. If you walk into
        a steakhouse, you can get a sirloin or a rib eye, but not sushi. Your
        options are constrained by what’s available. They are shaped by the
        first choice.
      </p>
      <p>We are limited by where our habits lead us. This is why mastering the
        decisive moments throughout your day is so important. Each day is made
        up of many moments, but it is really a few habitual choices that
        determine the path you take. These little choices stack up, each one
        setting the trajectory for how you spend the next chunk of time.</p>
      <p>Habits are the entry point, not the end point. They are the cab, not
        the gym.</p>
      <h3 class="x05-Head-A"><span id="23_13_How_to_Stop_Procra.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText158"></span>THE
        TWO-MINUTE RULE</h3>
      <p>Even when you know you should start small, it’s easy to start too
        big. When you dream about making a change, excitement inevitably takes
        over and you end up trying to do too much too soon. The most effective
        way I know to counteract this tendency is to use the <em>Two-Minute
          Rule</em>, which states, “When you start a new habit, it should take
        less than two minutes to do.”</p>
      <p>You’ll find that nearly any habit can be scaled down into a
        two-minute version:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>“Read before bed each night” becomes “Read one page.”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>“Do thirty minutes of yoga” becomes “Take out my yoga
            mat.”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>“Study for class” becomes “Open my notes.”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>“Fold the laundry” becomes “Fold one pair of socks.”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>“Run three miles” becomes “Tie my running shoes.”</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><span id="23_13_How_to_Stop_Procra.xhtml#page_163" class="pagebreak" title="163"></span>The idea is to make
        your habits as easy as possible
        to start. Anyone can meditate for one minute, read one page, or put one
        item of clothing away. And, as we have just discussed, this is a
        powerful strategy because once you’ve started doing the right thing, it
        is much easier to continue doing it. A new habit should not feel like a
        challenge. The actions that <em>follow</em> can be challenging, but the
        first two minutes should be easy. What you want is a “gateway habit”
        that naturally leads you down a more productive path.</p>
      <p>You can usually figure out the gateway habits that will lead to your
        desired outcome by mapping out your goals on a scale from “very easy” to
        “very hard.” For instance, running a marathon is very hard. Running a 5K
        is hard. Walking ten thousand steps is moderately difficult. Walking ten
        minutes is easy. And putting on your running shoes is very easy. Your
        goal might be to run a marathon, but your gateway habit is to put on
        your running shoes. That’s how you follow the Two-Minute Rule.</p>

      <p>People often think it’s weird to get hyped about reading one page or
        meditating for one minute or making one sales call. But the point is not
        to do one thing. The point is to master the habit of showing up. The
        truth is, a habit must be established before it can be improved. If you
        <span id="23_13_How_to_Stop_Procra.xhtml#page_164" class="pagebreak" title="164"></span>can’t learn the basic
        skill of showing up, then you
        have little hope of mastering the finer details. Instead of trying to
        engineer a perfect habit from the start, do the easy thing on a more
        consistent basis. You have to standardize before you can optimize.
      </p>
      <p>As you master the art of showing up, the first two minutes simply
        become a ritual at the beginning of a larger routine. This is not merely
        a hack to make habits easier but actually the ideal way to master a
        difficult skill. The more you ritualize the beginning of a process, the
        more likely it becomes that you can slip into the state of deep focus
        that is required to do great things. By doing the same warm-up before
        every workout, you make it easier to get into a state of peak
        performance. By following the same creative ritual, you make it easier
        to get into the hard work of creating. By developing a consistent <span
          id="23_13_How_to_Stop_Procra.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText159"></span>power-down
        habit, you make it easier to get to bed at a reasonable time each night.
        You may not be able to automate the whole process, but you can make the
        first action mindless. Make it easy to start and the rest will
        follow.</p>
      <p>The Two-Minute Rule can seem like a trick to some people. You know
        that the <em>real</em> goal is to do more than just two minutes, so it
        may feel like you’re trying to fool yourself. Nobody is actually
        aspiring to read one page or do one push-up or open their notes. And if
        you know it’s a mental trick, why would you fall for it?</p>
      <p>If the Two-Minute Rule feels forced, try this: do it for two minutes
        and then stop. Go for a run, but you <em>must</em> stop after two
        minutes. Start meditating, but you <em>must</em> stop after two minutes.
        Study Arabic, but you <em>must</em> stop after two minutes. It’s not a
        strategy for starting, it’s the whole thing. Your habit can
        <em>only</em> last one hundred and twenty seconds.
      </p>
      <p>One of my readers used this strategy to lose over one hundred pounds.
        In the beginning, he went to the gym each day, but he told himself he
        wasn’t allowed to stay for more than five minutes. He would go to the
        gym, exercise for five minutes, and leave as soon as his time was up.
        After a few weeks, he looked around and thought, “Well, I’m <span id="23_13_How_to_Stop_Procra.xhtml#page_165"
          class="pagebreak" title="165"></span>always coming here anyway. I might as well start
        staying a little longer.” A few years later, the weight was gone.</p>
      <p>Journaling provides another example. Nearly everyone can benefit from
        getting their thoughts out of their head and onto paper, but most people
        give up after a few days or avoid it entirely because journaling feels
        like a chore.<span id="23_13_How_to_Stop_Procra.xhtml#footnote-018-backlink"><a
            href="61_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_2" class="_idFootnoteLink noteref" role="doc-noteref">*</a></span> The
        secret is to always stay below the
        point where it feels like work. Greg McKeown, a leadership consultant
        from the United Kingdom, built a daily journaling habit by specifically
        writing <em>less</em> than he felt like. <span
          id="23_13_How_to_Stop_Procra.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText160"></span>He
        always stopped journaling before it seemed like a hassle. Ernest
        Hemingway believed in similar advice for any kind of writing. “The best
        way is to always stop when you are going good,” he said.</p>
      <p>Strategies like this work for another reason, too: they reinforce the
        identity you want to build. If you show up at the gym five days in a
        row—even if it’s just for two minutes—you are casting votes for your new
        identity. You’re not worried about getting in shape. You’re focused on
        becoming the type of person who doesn’t miss workouts. You’re taking the
        smallest action that confirms the type of person you want to be.</p>
      <p>We rarely think about change this way because everyone is consumed by
        the end goal. But one push-up is better than not exercising. One minute
        of guitar practice is better than none at all. One minute of reading is
        better than never picking up a book. It’s better to do less than you
        hoped than to do nothing at all.</p>
      <p>At some point, once you’ve established the habit and you’re showing
        up each day, you can combine the Two-Minute Rule with a technique we
        call <span id="23_13_How_to_Stop_Procra.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText161"></span><em>habit
          shaping</em> to scale your habit back up toward your ultimate goal.
        Start by mastering the first two minutes of the smallest version of
        <span id="23_13_How_to_Stop_Procra.xhtml#page_167" class="pagebreak" title="167"></span>the behavior. Then,
        advance to an intermediate step
        and repeat the process—focusing on just the first two minutes and
        mastering that stage before moving on to the next level. Eventually,
        you’ll end up with the habit you had originally hoped to build while
        still keeping your focus where it should be: on the first two minutes of
        the behavior.

        Habits Inevitable and Bad Habits Impossible</h2>
      <p>I<span class="RunIn">N THE SUMMER OF 1830, </span>Victor Hugo was
        facing an impossible deadline. Twelve months earlier, the French author
        had promised his publisher a new book. But instead of writing, he spent
        that year pursuing other projects, entertaining guests, and delaying his
        work. Frustrated, Hugo’s publisher responded by setting a deadline less
        than six months away. The book had to be finished by February 1831.</p>
      <p>Hugo concocted a strange plan to beat his procrastination. He
        collected all of his clothes and asked an assistant to lock them away in
        a large chest. He was left with nothing to wear except a large shawl.
        Lacking any suitable clothing to go outdoors, <span
          id="24_14_How_to_Make_Good_H.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText162"></span>he
        remained in his study and wrote furiously during the fall and winter of
        1830. <em>The Hunchback of Notre Dame</em> was published two weeks early
        on January 14, 1831.<span id="24_14_How_to_Make_Good_H.xhtml#footnote-021-backlink"><a
            href="62_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_1" class="_idFootnoteLink noteref" role="doc-noteref">*</a></span></p>
      <p>Sometimes success is less about making good habits easy and more
        about making bad habits hard. This is an inversion of the 3rd Law of
        Behavior Change: <em>make it difficult</em>. If you find yourself
        continually <span id="24_14_How_to_Make_Good_H.xhtml#page_170" class="pagebreak" title="170"></span>struggling
        to follow through on
        your plans, then you can take a page from Victor Hugo and make your bad
        habits more difficult by creating what psychologists call a
        <em>commitment device</em>.
      </p>
      <p><span id="24_14_How_to_Make_Good_H.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText163"></span>A
        commitment device is a choice you make in the present that controls your
        actions in the future. It is a way to lock in future behavior, bind you
        to good habits, and restrict you from bad ones. When Victor Hugo shut
        his clothes away so he could focus on writing, he was creating a
        commitment device.<span id="24_14_How_to_Make_Good_H.xhtml#footnote-020-backlink"><a
            href="63_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_2" class="_idFootnoteLink noteref" role="doc-noteref">*</a></span></p>
      <p>There are many ways to create a commitment device. You can reduce
        overeating by purchasing food in individual packages rather than in bulk
        size. You can voluntarily ask to be added to the banned list at casinos
        and online poker sites to prevent future gambling sprees. I’ve even
        heard of athletes who have to “make weight” for a competition choosing
        to leave their wallets at home during the week before weigh-in so they
        won’t be tempted to buy fast food.</p>
      <p>As another example, my friend and fellow habits expert Nir Eyal
        purchased an outlet timer, which is an adapter that he plugged in
        between his internet router and the power outlet. At 10 p.m. each night,
        the <span id="24_14_How_to_Make_Good_H.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText164"></span>outlet
        timer cuts off the power to the router. When the internet goes off,
        everyone knows it is time to go to bed.</p>
      <p>Commitment devices are useful because they enable you to take
        advantage of good intentions before you can fall victim to temptation.
        Whenever I’m looking to cut calories, for example, I will ask the waiter
        to split my meal and box half of it to go <em>before</em> the meal is
        served. If I waited until the meal came out and told myself “I’ll just
        eat half,” it would never work.</p>
      <p><span id="24_14_How_to_Make_Good_H.xhtml#page_171" class="pagebreak" title="171"></span>The key is to change
        the task such that it requires
        more work to get <em>out</em> of the good habit than to get started on
        it. If you’re feeling motivated to get in shape, schedule a yoga session
        and pay ahead of time. If you’re excited about the business you want to
        start, email an entrepreneur you respect and set up a consulting call.
        When the time comes to act, the only way to bail is to cancel the
        meeting, which requires effort and may cost money.</p>
      <p>Commitment devices increase the odds that you’ll do the right thing
        in the future by making bad habits difficult in the present. However, we
        can do even better. We can make good habits inevitable and bad habits
        impossible.</p>
      <h3 class="x05-Head-A">HOW TO AUTOMATE A HABIT AND NEVER THINK ABOUT IT
        AGAIN</h3>
      <p>John Henry Patterson was born in Dayton, Ohio, in 1844. He spent his
        childhood doing chores on the family farm and working shifts at his
        father’s sawmill. After attending college at Dartmouth, Patterson
        returned to Ohio and opened a small supply store for coal miners.</p>
      <p>It seemed like a good opportunity. The store faced little competition
        and enjoyed a steady stream of customers, but still struggled to make
        money. That was when Patterson discovered his employees were stealing
        from him.</p>
      <p>In the mid-1800s, employee theft was a common problem. Receipts were
        kept in an open drawer and could easily be altered or discarded. There
        were no video cameras to review behavior and no software to track
        transactions. Unless you were willing to hover over your employees every
        minute of the day, or to manage all transactions yourself, it was
        difficult to prevent theft.</p>
      <p>As Patterson mulled over his predicament, he came across an
        advertisement for a new invention called Ritty’s Incorruptible Cashier.
        <span id="24_14_How_to_Make_Good_H.xhtml#page_172" class="pagebreak" title="172"></span>Designed by fellow
        Dayton resident James Ritty, it
        was the first cash register. The machine automatically locked the cash
        and receipts inside after each transaction. Patterson bought two for
        fifty dollars each.
      </p>
      <p>Employee theft at his store vanished overnight. In the next six
        months, <span id="24_14_How_to_Make_Good_H.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText166"></span>Patterson’s
        business went from losing money to making $5,000 in profit—the
        equivalent of more than $100,000 today.</p>
      <p>Patterson was so impressed with the machine that he changed
        businesses. He bought the rights to Ritty’s invention and opened the
        National Cash Register Company. Ten years later, National Cash Register
        had over one thousand employees and was on its way to becoming one of
        the most successful businesses of its time.</p>
      <p>The best way to break a bad habit is to make it impractical to do.
        Increase the friction until you don’t even have the option to act. The
        brilliance of the cash register was that it automated ethical behavior
        by making stealing practically impossible. Rather than trying to change
        the employees, it made the preferred behavior automatic.</p>
      <p>Some actions—like installing a cash register—pay off again and again.
        These onetime choices require a little bit of effort up front but create
        increasing value over time. I’m fascinated by the idea that a single
        choice can deliver returns again and again, and I surveyed my readers on
        their favorite <span id="24_14_How_to_Make_Good_H.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText167"></span>onetime
        actions that lead to better long-term habits. The table on the following
        page shares some of the most popular answers.</p>
      <p>I’d wager that if the average person were to simply do half of the
        onetime actions on this list—even if they didn’t give another thought to
        their habits—most would find themselves living a better life a year from
        now. These onetime actions are a straightforward way to employ the 3rd
        Law of Behavior Change. They make it easier to sleep well, eat healthy,
        be productive, save money, and generally live better.</p>

      <p>Of course, there are many ways to automate good habits and eliminate
        bad ones. Typically, they involve putting technology to work for you.
        Technology can transform actions that were once hard, annoying, and
        complicated into behaviors that are easy, painless, and simple. It is
        the most reliable and effective way to guarantee the right behavior.</p>
      <p>This is particularly useful for behaviors that happen too
        infrequently to become habitual. Things you have to do monthly or
        yearly—like rebalancing your investment portfolio—are never repeated
        frequently enough to become a habit, so they benefit in particular from
        technology “remembering” to do them for you.</p>
      <p><span id="24_14_How_to_Make_Good_H.xhtml#page_174" class="pagebreak" title="174"></span>Other examples include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Medicine: Prescriptions can be automatically refilled.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Personal finance: Employees can save for retirement with an
            automatic wage deduction.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Cooking: Meal-delivery services can do your grocery
            shopping.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Productivity: Social media browsing can be cut off with a website
            blocker.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>When you automate as much of your life as possible, you can spend
        your effort on the tasks machines cannot do yet. Each habit that we hand
        over to the authority of technology frees up time and energy to pour
        into the next stage of growth. As mathematician and philosopher Alfred
        North Whitehead wrote, “<span id="24_14_How_to_Make_Good_H.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText168"></span>Civilization
        advances by extending the number of operations we can perform without
        thinking about them.”</p>
      <p>Of course, the power of technology can work against us as well.
        Binge-watching becomes a habit because you have to put more effort in to
        <em>stop</em> looking at the screen than to continue doing so. Instead
        of pressing a button to advance to the next episode, Netflix or YouTube
        will autoplay it for you. All you have to do is keep your eyes open.
      </p>
      <p>Technology creates a level of convenience that enables you to act on
        your smallest whims and desires. At the mere suggestion of hunger, you
        can have food delivered to your door. At the slightest hint of boredom,
        you can get lost in the vast expanse of social media. When the effort
        required to act on your desires becomes effectively zero, you can find
        yourself slipping into whatever impulse arises at the moment. The
        downside of automation is that we can find ourselves jumping from easy
        task to easy task without making time for more difficult, but ultimately
        more rewarding, work.</p>
      <p>I often find myself gravitating toward social media during any <span
          id="24_14_How_to_Make_Good_H.xhtml#page_175" class="pagebreak" title="175"></span>downtime. If I feel bored
        for just a fraction of a
        second, I reach for my phone. It’s easy to write off these minor
        distractions as “just taking a break,” but over time they can accumulate
        into a serious issue. The constant tug of “just one more minute” can
        prevent me from doing anything of consequence. (I’m not the only one.
        <span id="24_14_How_to_Make_Good_H.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText169"></span>The
        average person spends over two hours per day on social media. What could
        you do with an extra six hundred hours per year?)
      </p>
      <p>During the year I was writing this book, I experimented with a new
        time management strategy. Every Monday, my assistant would reset the
        passwords on all my social media accounts, which logged me out on each
        device. All week I worked without distraction. On Friday, she would send
        me the new passwords. I had the entire weekend to enjoy what social
        media had to offer until Monday morning when she would do it again. (If
        you don’t have an assistant, team up with a friend or family member and
        reset each other’s passwords each week.)</p>
      <p>One of the biggest surprises was how quickly I adapted. Within the
        first week of locking myself out of social media, I realized that I
        didn’t need to check it nearly as often as I had been, and I certainly
        didn’t need it each day. It had simply been so easy that it had become
        the default. Once my bad habit became impossible, I discovered that I
        <em>did</em> actually have the motivation to work on more meaningful
        tasks. After I removed the mental candy from my environment, it became
        much easier to eat the healthy stuff.
      </p>
      <p>When working in your favor, automation can make your good habits
        inevitable and your bad habits impossible. It is the ultimate way to
        lock in future behavior rather than relying on willpower in the moment.
        By utilizing commitment devices, strategic onetime decisions, and
        technology, you can create an environment of inevitability—a space where
        good habits are not just an outcome you hope for but an outcome that is
        virtually guaranteed.</p>

        his hometown of Omaha, Nebraska, and bought a one-way ticket to Karachi,
        Pakistan.</p>
      <p>Karachi was one of the most populous cities in the world. By 1998,
        <span id="26_15_The_Cardinal_Rule_.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText170"></span>over
        nine million people called it home. It was the economic center of
        Pakistan and a transportation hub, with some of the most active airports
        and seaports in the region. In the commercial parts of town, you could
        find all of the standard urban amenities and bustling downtown streets.
        But Karachi was also one of the <em>least</em> livable cities in the
        world.
      </p>
      <p><span id="26_15_The_Cardinal_Rule_.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText171"></span>Over
        60 percent of Karachi’s residents lived in squatter settlements and
        slums. These densely packed neighborhoods were filled with makeshift
        houses cobbled together from old boards, cinder blocks, and other
        discarded materials. There was no waste removal system, no electricity
        grid, no clean water supply. When dry, the streets were a combination of
        dust and trash. When wet, they became a muddy pit of sewage. Mosquito
        colonies thrived in pools of stagnant water, and children played among
        the garbage.</p>
      <p>The unsanitary conditions lead to widespread illness and disease.
        <span id="26_15_The_Cardinal_Rule_.xhtml#page_184" class="pagebreak" title="184"></span>Contaminated water
        sources caused epidemics of
        diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Nearly one third of the children
        living there were malnourished. With so many people crammed into such a
        small space, viruses and bacterial infections spread rapidly. <span
          id="26_15_The_Cardinal_Rule_.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText172"></span>It was
        this public health crisis that had brought Stephen Luby to Pakistan.
      </p>
      <p>Luby and his team realized that in an environment with poor
        sanitation, the simple habit of washing your hands could make a real
        difference in the health of the residents. But they soon discovered that
        many people were already aware that handwashing was important.</p>
      <p>And yet, despite this knowledge, many residents were washing their
        hands in a haphazard fashion. Some people would just run their hands
        under the water quickly. Others would only wash one hand. Many would
        simply forget to wash their hands before preparing food. Everyone
        <em>said</em> handwashing was important, but few people made a habit out
        of it. The problem wasn’t knowledge. The problem was consistency.
      </p>
      <p>That was when Luby and his team partnered with Procter &amp; Gamble
        to supply the neighborhood with Safeguard soap. Compared to your
        standard bar of soap, using Safeguard was a more enjoyable
        experience.</p>
      <p>“<span id="26_15_The_Cardinal_Rule_.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText173"></span>In
        Pakistan, Safeguard was a premium soap,” Luby told me. “The study
        participants commonly mentioned how much they liked it.” The soap foamed
        easily, and people were able to lather their hands with suds. It smelled
        great. Instantly, handwashing became slightly more pleasurable.</p>
      <p>“I see the goal of handwashing promotion not as behavior change but
        as habit adoption,” Luby said. “It is a lot easier for people to adopt a
        product that provides a strong positive sensory signal, for example the
        mint taste of toothpaste, than it is to adopt a habit that does not
        provide pleasurable sensory feedback, like flossing one’s teeth. The
        marketing team at Procter &amp; Gamble talked about trying to create a
        positive handwashing experience.”</p>
      <p><span id="26_15_The_Cardinal_Rule_.xhtml#page_185" class="pagebreak" title="185"></span>Within months, the
        researchers saw a rapid shift in
        the health of children in the neighborhood. <span
          id="26_15_The_Cardinal_Rule_.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText174"></span>The
        rate of diarrhea fell by 52 percent; pneumonia by 48 percent; and
        impetigo, a bacterial skin infection, by 35 percent.</p>
      <p>The long-term effects were even better. “We went back to some of the
        households in Karachi six years after,” Luby told me. “<span
          id="26_15_The_Cardinal_Rule_.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText175"></span>Over
        95 percent of households who had been given the soap for free and
        encouraged to wash their hands had a handwashing station with soap and
        water available when our study team visited. . . . We had not given any
        soap to the intervention group for over five years, but during the trial
        they had become so habituated to wash their hands, that they had
        maintained the practice.” It was a powerful example of the fourth and
        final Law of Behavior Change: <em>make it satisfying.</em></p>
      <p>We are more likely to repeat a behavior when the experience is
        satisfying. This is entirely logical. Feelings of pleasure—even minor
        ones like washing your hands with soap that smells nice and lathers
        well—are signals that tell the brain: “This feels good. Do this again,
        next time.” Pleasure teaches your brain that a behavior is worth
        remembering and repeating.</p>
      <p>Take the story of chewing gum. <span id="26_15_The_Cardinal_Rule_.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText176"></span>Chewing
        gum had been sold commercially throughout the 1800s, but it wasn’t until
        Wrigley launched in 1891 that it became a worldwide habit. Early
        versions were made from relatively bland resins—chewy, but not tasty.
        <span id="26_15_The_Cardinal_Rule_.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText177"></span>Wrigley
        revolutionized the industry by adding flavors like Spearmint and Juicy
        Fruit, which made the product flavorful and fun to use. Then they went a
        step further and began pushing chewing gum as a pathway to a clean
        mouth. Advertisements told readers to “Refresh Your Taste.”
      </p>
      <p>Tasty flavors and the feeling of a fresh mouth provided little bits
        of immediate reinforcement and made the product satisfying to use.
        Consumption skyrocketed, and <span id="26_15_The_Cardinal_Rule_.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText178"></span>Wrigley
        became the largest chewing gum company in the world.</p>
      <p><span id="26_15_The_Cardinal_Rule_.xhtml#page_186" class="pagebreak" title="186"></span><span
          id="26_15_The_Cardinal_Rule_.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText179"></span>Toothpaste
        had a similar trajectory. Manufacturers enjoyed great success when they
        added flavors like spearmint, peppermint, and cinnamon to their
        products. These flavors don’t improve the effectiveness of toothpaste.
        They simply create a “clean mouth” feel and make the experience of
        brushing your teeth more pleasurable. My wife actually stopped using
        Sensodyne because she didn’t like the aftertaste. She switched to a
        brand with a stronger mint flavor, which proved to be more
        satisfying.</p>
      <p>Conversely, if an experience is not satisfying, we have little reason
        to repeat it. In my research, I came across the story of a woman who had
        a narcissistic relative who drove her nuts. In an attempt to spend less
        time with this egomaniac, she acted as dull and as boring as possible
        whenever he was around. Within a few encounters, <span
          id="26_15_The_Cardinal_Rule_.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText180"></span><em>he</em>
        started avoiding <em>her</em> because he found her so uninteresting.</p>
      <p>Stories like these are evidence of the Cardinal Rule of Behavior
        Change: <em>What is rewarded is repeated. What is punished is
          avoided.</em> You learn what to do in the future based on what you were
        rewarded for doing (or punished for doing) in the past. Positive
        emotions cultivate habits. Negative emotions destroy them.</p>
      <p>The first three laws of behavior change—<em>make it obvious, make it
          attractive,</em> and <em>make it easy</em>—increase the odds that a
        behavior will be performed <em>this</em> time. The fourth law of
        behavior change—<em>make it satisfying</em>—increases the odds that a
        behavior will be repeated <em>next</em> time. It completes the habit
        loop.</p>
      <p>But there is a trick. We are not looking for just any type of
        satisfaction. We are looking for immediate satisfaction.</p>

        MISMATCH BETWEEN IMMEDIATE AND DELAYED
        REWARDS</h3>
      <p>Imagine you’re an animal roaming the plains of Africa—a giraffe or an
        elephant or a lion. On any given day, most of your decisions have an
        immediate impact. You are always thinking about what to eat or where to
        sleep or how to avoid a predator. You are constantly focused on the
        present or the very near future. You live in what scientists call an
        <em>immediate-return environment</em> because your actions instantly
        deliver clear and immediate outcomes.
      </p>
      <p>Now switch back to your human self. In modern society, many of the
        choices you make today will <em>not</em> benefit you immediately. If you
        do a good job at work, you’ll get a paycheck in a few weeks. If you
        exercise today, perhaps you won’t be overweight next year. If you save
        money now, maybe you’ll have enough for retirement decades from now. You
        live in what scientists call a <em>delayed-return environment</em>
        because you can work for years before your actions deliver the intended
        payoff.</p>
      <p>The human brain did not evolve for life in a delayed-return
        environment. <span id="26_15_The_Cardinal_Rule_.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText181"></span>The
        earliest remains of modern humans, known as <em>Homo sapiens
          sapiens</em>, are approximately two hundred thousand years old. These
        were the first humans to have a brain relatively similar to ours. In
        particular, <span id="26_15_The_Cardinal_Rule_.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText182"></span>the
        neocortex—the newest part of the brain and the region responsible for
        higher functions like language—was roughly the same size two hundred
        thousand years ago as today. You are walking around with the same
        hardware as your Paleolithic ancestors.</p>
      <p>It is only recently—during the last five hundred years or so—that
        <span id="26_15_The_Cardinal_Rule_.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText183"></span>society
        has shifted to a predominantly delayed-return environment.<span
          id="26_15_The_Cardinal_Rule_.xhtml#footnote-024-backlink"><a href="64_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_1"
            class="_idFootnoteLink noteref" role="doc-noteref">*</a></span> <span
          id="26_15_The_Cardinal_Rule_.xhtml#page_188" class="pagebreak" title="188"></span>Compared to the age of the
        brain, modern society is
        brand-new. In the last one hundred years, we have seen the rise of the
        car, the airplane, the television, the personal computer, the internet,
        the smartphone, and Beyoncé. <span id="26_15_The_Cardinal_Rule_.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText184"></span>The
        world has changed much in recent years, but human nature has changed
        little.
      </p>
      <p>Similar to other animals on the African savannah, our ancestors spent
        their days responding to grave threats, securing the next meal, and
        taking shelter from a storm. It made sense to place a high value on
        instant gratification. The distant future was less of a concern. And
        after thousands of generations in an immediate-return environment, <span
          id="26_15_The_Cardinal_Rule_.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText185"></span>our
        brains evolved to prefer quick payoffs to long-term ones.</p>
      <p>Behavioral economists refer to this tendency as <em>time
          inconsistency</em>. That is, the way your brain evaluates rewards is
        inconsistent across time.<span id="26_15_The_Cardinal_Rule_.xhtml#footnote-023-backlink"><a
            href="65_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_2" class="_idFootnoteLink noteref" role="doc-noteref">*</a></span> You
        value the present more than the
        future. Usually, this tendency serves us well. A reward that is
        <em>certain</em> right now is typically worth more than one that is
        merely <em>possible</em> in the future. But occasionally, our bias
        toward instant gratification causes problems.
      </p>
      <p>Why would someone smoke if they know it increases the risk of lung
        cancer? Why would someone overeat when they know it increases their risk
        of obesity? Why would someone have unsafe sex if they know it can result
        in sexually transmitted disease? Once you understand how the brain
        prioritizes rewards, the answers become clear: the consequences of bad
        habits are delayed while the rewards are immediate. Smoking might kill
        you in ten years, but it reduces stress and eases your nicotine cravings
        <em>now</em>. Overeating is harmful in the long run but appetizing in
        the moment. Sex—safe or not—provides pleasure right away. <span
          id="26_15_The_Cardinal_Rule_.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText186"></span>Disease
        and infection won’t show up for days or weeks, even years.
      </p>
      <p>Every habit produces multiple outcomes across time. Unfortunately,
        <span id="26_15_The_Cardinal_Rule_.xhtml#page_189" class="pagebreak" title="189"></span>these outcomes are often
        misaligned. With our bad
        habits, the immediate outcome usually feels good, but the ultimate
        outcome feels bad. With good habits, it is the reverse: the immediate
        outcome is unenjoyable, but the ultimate outcome feels good. The French
        economist <span id="26_15_The_Cardinal_Rule_.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText187"></span>Frédéric
        Bastiat explained the problem clearly when he wrote, “It almost always
        happens that when the immediate consequence is favorable, the later
        consequences are disastrous, and vice versa. . . . Often, the sweeter
        the first fruit of a habit, the more bitter are its later fruits.”
      </p>
      <p>Put another way, the costs of your good habits are in the present.
        The costs of your bad habits are in the future.</p>
      <p>The brain’s tendency to prioritize the present moment means you can’t
        rely on good intentions. When you make a plan—to lose weight, write a
        book, or learn a language—you are actually making plans for your future
        self. And when you envision what you want your life to be like, it is
        easy to see the value in taking actions with long-term benefits. We all
        want better lives for our future selves. However, when the moment of
        decision arrives, instant gratification usually wins. You are no longer
        making a choice for <span id="26_15_The_Cardinal_Rule_.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText188"></span>Future
        You, who dreams of being fitter or wealthier or happier. You are
        choosing for Present You, who wants to be full, pampered, and
        entertained. As a general rule, the more immediate pleasure you get from
        an action, the more strongly you should question whether it aligns with
        your long-term goals.<span id="26_15_The_Cardinal_Rule_.xhtml#footnote-022-backlink"><a
            href="66_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_3" class="_idFootnoteLink noteref" role="doc-noteref">*</a></span></p>
      <p>With a fuller understanding of what causes our brain to repeat some
        behaviors and avoid others, let’s update the Cardinal Rule of Behavior
        Change: What is <em>immediately</em> rewarded is repeated. What is
        <em>immediately</em> punished is avoided.
      </p>
      <p><span id="26_15_The_Cardinal_Rule_.xhtml#page_190" class="pagebreak" title="190"></span>Our preference for
        instant gratification reveals an
        important truth about success: because of how we are wired, most people
        will spend all day chasing quick hits of satisfaction. The road less
        traveled is the road of delayed gratification. If you’re willing to wait
        for the rewards, you’ll face less competition and often get a bigger
        payoff. As the saying goes, the last mile is always the least
        crowded.</p>
      <p>This is precisely what research has shown. <span
          id="26_15_The_Cardinal_Rule_.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText189"></span>People
        who are better at delaying gratification have higher SAT scores, lower
        levels of substance abuse, lower likelihood of obesity, better responses
        to stress, and superior social skills. We’ve all seen this play out in
        our own lives. If you delay watching television and get your homework
        done, you’ll generally learn more and get better grades. If you don’t
        buy desserts and chips at the store, you’ll often eat healthier food
        when you get home. At some point, success in nearly every field requires
        you to ignore an immediate reward in favor of a delayed reward.</p>
      <p>Here’s the problem: most people <em>know</em> that delaying
        gratification is the wise approach. They want the benefits of good
        habits: to be healthy, productive, at peace. But these outcomes are
        seldom top-of-mind at the decisive moment. Thankfully, it’s possible to
        train yourself to delay gratification—but you need to work with the
        grain of human nature, not against it. The best way to do this is to add
        a little bit of immediate pleasure to the habits that pay off in the
        long-run and a little bit of immediate pain to ones that don’t.</p>
      <h3 class="x05-Head-A">HOW TO TURN INSTANT GRATIFICATION TO YOUR
        ADVANTAGE</h3>
      <p>The vital thing in getting a habit to stick is to feel
        successful—even if it’s in a small way. The feeling of success is a
        signal that your habit paid off and that the work was worth the
        effort.</p>
      <p>In a perfect world, the reward for a good habit is the habit itself.
        In <span id="26_15_The_Cardinal_Rule_.xhtml#page_191" class="pagebreak" title="191"></span>the real world, good
        habits tend to feel worthwhile
        only after they have provided you with something. Early on, it’s all
        sacrifice. You’ve gone to the gym a few times, but you’re not stronger
        or fitter or faster—at least, not in any noticeable sense. It’s only
        months later, once you shed a few pounds or your arms gain some
        definition, that it becomes easier to exercise for its own sake. In the
        beginning, you need a reason to stay on track. This is why immediate
        rewards are essential. They keep you excited while the delayed rewards
        accumulate in the background.</p>
      <p>What we’re really talking about here—when we’re discussing immediate
        rewards—is the ending of a behavior. The ending of any experience is
        vital because we tend to remember it more than other phases. You want
        the ending of your habit to be satisfying. The best approach is to use
        <em>reinforcement</em>, which refers to the process of using an
        immediate reward to increase the rate of a behavior. Habit stacking,
        which we covered in Chapter 5, ties your habit to an immediate cue,
        which makes it obvious when to start. Reinforcement ties your habit to
        an immediate reward, which makes it satisfying when you finish.
      </p>
      <p>Immediate reinforcement can be especially helpful when dealing with
        <em>habits of avoidance</em>, which are behaviors you want to stop
        doing. It can be challenging to stick with habits like “no frivolous
        purchases” or “no alcohol this month” because nothing happens when you
        skip happy hour drinks or don’t buy that pair of shoes. It can be hard
        to feel satisfied when there is no action in the first place. All you’re
        doing is resisting temptation, and there isn’t much satisfying about
        that.
      </p>
      <p>One solution is to turn the situation on its head. You want to make
        avoidance visible. Open a savings account and label it for something you
        want—maybe “Leather Jacket.” Whenever you pass on a purchase, put the
        same amount of money in the account. Skip your morning latte? Transfer
        $5. Pass on another month of Netflix? Move $10 over. It’s like creating
        a loyalty program for yourself. The immediate reward of seeing yourself
        save money toward the leather jacket feels <span id="26_15_The_Cardinal_Rule_.xhtml#page_192" class="pagebreak"
          title="192"></span>a lot better than being deprived. You are making it
        satisfying to do nothing.</p>
      <p>One of my readers and his wife used a similar setup. They wanted to
        stop eating out so much and start cooking together more. They labeled
        their savings account “Trip to Europe.” Whenever they skipped going out
        to eat, they transferred $50 into the account. At the end of the year,
        they put the money toward the vacation.</p>
      <p>It is worth noting that it is important to select short-term rewards
        that reinforce your identity rather than ones that conflict with it.
        Buying a new jacket is fine if you’re trying to lose weight or read more
        books, but it doesn’t work if you’re trying to budget and save money.
        Instead, taking a bubble bath or going on a leisurely walk are good
        examples of rewarding yourself with free time, which aligns with your
        ultimate goal of more freedom and financial independence. Similarly, if
        your reward for exercising is eating a bowl of ice cream, then you’re
        casting votes for conflicting identities, and it ends up being a wash.
        Instead, maybe your reward is a massage, which is both a luxury and a
        vote toward taking care of your body. Now the short-term reward is
        aligned with your long-term vision of being a healthy person.</p>
      <p>Eventually, as intrinsic rewards like a better mood, more energy, and
        reduced stress kick in, you’ll become less concerned with chasing the
        secondary reward. The identity itself becomes the reinforcer. You do it
        because it’s who you are and it feels good to be you. The more a habit
        becomes part of your life, the less you need outside encouragement to
        follow through. Incentives can start a habit. Identity sustains a
        habit.</p>
      <p>That said, it takes time for the evidence to accumulate and a new
        identity to emerge. Immediate reinforcement helps maintain motivation in
        the short term while you’re waiting for the long-term rewards to
        arrive.</p>
      <p>In summary, a habit needs to be enjoyable for it to last. Simple bits
        <span id="26_15_The_Cardinal_Rule_.xhtml#page_193" class="pagebreak" title="193"></span>of reinforcement—like
        soap that smells great or
        toothpaste that has a refreshing mint flavor or seeing $50 hit your
        savings account—can offer the immediate pleasure you need to enjoy a
        habit. And change is easy when it is enjoyable.

        Good Habits Every Day</h2>
      <p>I<span class="RunIn">N 1993</span>, a bank in Abbotsford, Canada,
        hired a twenty-three-year-old stockbroker named Trent Dyrsmid.
        Abbotsford was a relatively small suburb, tucked away in the shadow of
        nearby Vancouver, where most of the big business deals were being made.
        Given the location, and the fact that Dyrsmid was a rookie, nobody
        expected too much of him. But he made brisk progress thanks to a simple
        daily habit.</p>
      <p>Dyrsmid began each morning with two jars on his desk. One was filled
        with 120 paper clips. The other was empty. As soon as he settled in each
        day, he would make a sales call. Immediately after, he would move one
        paper clip from the full jar to the empty jar and the process would
        begin again. “Every morning <span id="27_16_How_to_Stick_with_.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText190"></span>I
        would start with 120 paper clips in one jar and I would keep dialing the
        phone until I had moved them all to the second jar,” he told me.</p>
      <p>Within eighteen months, Dyrsmid was bringing in $5 million to the
        firm. By age twenty-four, he was making $75,000 per year—the equivalent
        of $125,000 today. Not long after, he landed a six-figure job with
        another company.</p>
      <p>I like to refer to this technique as the Paper Clip Strategy and,
        over <span id="27_16_How_to_Stick_with_.xhtml#page_196" class="pagebreak" title="196"></span>the years, I’ve
        heard from readers
        who have employed it in a variety of ways. One woman shifted a hairpin
        from one container to another whenever she wrote a page of her book.
        Another man moved a marble from one bin to the next after each set of
        push-ups.</p>
      <p>Making progress is satisfying, and visual measures—like moving paper
        clips or hairpins or marbles—provide clear evidence of your progress. As
        a result, they reinforce your behavior and add a little bit of immediate
        satisfaction to any activity. Visual measurement comes in many forms:
        food journals, workout logs, loyalty punch cards, the progress bar on a
        software download, even the page numbers in a book. But perhaps the best
        way to measure your progress is with a <em>habit tracker</em>.</p>
      <h3 class="x05-Head-A">HOW TO KEEP YOUR HABITS ON TRACK</h3>
      <p>A habit tracker is a simple way to measure whether you did a habit.
        The most basic format is to get a calendar and cross off each day you
        stick with your routine. For example, if you meditate on Monday,
        Wednesday, and Friday, each of those dates gets an <em>X</em>. As time
        rolls by, the calendar becomes a record of your habit streak.</p>
      <p>Countless people have tracked their habits, but perhaps the most
        famous was <span id="27_16_How_to_Stick_with_.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText191"></span>Benjamin
        Franklin. Beginning at age twenty, Franklin carried a small booklet
        everywhere he went and used it to track thirteen personal virtues. This
        list included goals like “Lose no time. Be always employed in something
        useful” and “Avoid trifling conversation.” At the end of each day,
        Franklin would open his booklet and record his progress.</p>
      <p>Jerry Seinfeld reportedly uses a habit tracker to stick with his
        streak of writing jokes. In the documentary <em>Comedian</em>, he
        explains that his goal is simply to “never break the chain” of writing
        jokes every day. In other words, he is not focused on how good or bad a
        particular joke is <span id="27_16_How_to_Stick_with_.xhtml#page_197" class="pagebreak" title="197"></span>or
        how inspired he feels. He is
        simply focused on showing up and adding to his streak.</p>
      <p>“Don’t break the chain” is a powerful mantra. Don’t break the chain
        of sales calls and you’ll build a successful book of business. Don’t
        break the chain of workouts and you’ll get fit faster than you’d expect.
        <span id="27_16_How_to_Stick_with_.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText192"></span>Don’t
        break the chain of creating every day and you will end up with an
        impressive portfolio. Habit tracking is powerful because it leverages
        multiple Laws of Behavior Change. It simultaneously makes a behavior
        obvious, attractive, and satisfying.
      </p>
      <p>Let’s break down each one.</p>
      <h4 class="x05-Head-B">Benefit #1: Habit tracking is obvious.</h4>
      <p>Recording your last action creates a trigger that can initiate your
        next one. Habit tracking naturally builds a series of visual cues like
        the streak of <em>X</em>’s on your calendar or the list of meals in your
        food log. When you look at the calendar and see your streak, you’ll be
        reminded to act again. Research has shown that <span
          id="27_16_How_to_Stick_with_.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText193"></span>people
        who track their progress on goals like losing weight, quitting smoking,
        and lowering blood pressure are all more likely to improve than those
        who don’t. One study of more than sixteen hundred people found that
        <span id="27_16_How_to_Stick_with_.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText194"></span>those
        who kept a daily food log lost twice as much weight as those who did
        not. The mere act of tracking a behavior can spark the urge to change
        it.
      </p>
      <p>Habit tracking also keeps you honest. Most of us have a distorted
        view of our own behavior. We think we act better than we do. Measurement
        offers one way to overcome our blindness to our own behavior and notice
        what’s really going on each day. One glance at the paper clips in the
        container and you immediately know how much work you have (or haven’t)
        been putting in. When the evidence is right in front of you, you’re less
        likely to lie to yourself.</p>
      <h4 class="x05-Head-B"><span id="27_16_How_to_Stick_with_.xhtml#page_198" class="pagebreak"
          title="198"></span>Benefit #2: Habit tracking is attractive.</h4>
      <p><span id="27_16_How_to_Stick_with_.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText195"></span>The
        most effective form of motivation is progress. When we get a signal that
        we are moving forward, we become more motivated to continue down that
        path. In this way, habit tracking can have an addictive effect on
        motivation. Each small win feeds your desire.</p>
      <p>This can be particularly powerful on a bad day. When you’re feeling
        down, it’s easy to forget about all the progress you have already made.
        Habit tracking provides visual proof of your hard work—a subtle reminder
        of how far you’ve come. Plus, the empty square you see each morning can
        motivate you to get started because you don’t want to lose your progress
        by breaking the streak.</p>
      <h4 class="x05-Head-B">Benefit #3: Habit tracking is satisfying.</h4>
      <p>This is the most crucial benefit of all. Tracking can become its own
        form of reward. It is satisfying to cross an item off your to-do list,
        to complete an entry in your workout log, or to mark an <em>X</em> on
        the calendar. It feels good to watch your results grow—the size of your
        investment portfolio, the length of your book manuscript—and if it feels
        good, then you’re more likely to endure.</p>
      <p>Habit tracking also helps keep your eye on the ball: you’re focused
        on the process rather than the result. You’re not fixated on getting
        six-pack abs, you’re just trying to keep the streak alive and become the
        type of person who doesn’t miss workouts.</p>
      <p>In summary, habit tracking (1) creates a visual cue that can remind
        you to act, (2) is inherently motivating because you see the progress
        you are making and don’t want to lose it, and (3) feels satisfying
        whenever you record another successful instance of your habit.
        Furthermore, habit tracking provides visual proof that you are casting
        votes <span id="27_16_How_to_Stick_with_.xhtml#page_199" class="pagebreak" title="199"></span>for the type of
        person you wish to
        become, which is a delightful form of immediate and intrinsic
        gratification.<span id="27_16_How_to_Stick_with_.xhtml#footnote-025-backlink"><a
            href="67_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_1" class="_idFootnoteLink noteref" role="doc-noteref">*</a></span></p>
      <p>You may be wondering, if habit tracking is so useful, why have I
        waited so long to talk about it?</p>
      <p>Despite all the benefits, I’ve left this discussion until now for a
        simple reason: many people resist the idea of tracking and measuring. It
        can feel like a burden because it forces you into <em>two</em> habits:
        the habit you’re trying to build and the habit of tracking it. Counting
        calories sounds like a hassle when you’re already struggling to follow a
        diet. Writing down every sales call seems tedious when you’ve got work
        to do. It feels easier to say, “I’ll just eat less.” Or, “I’ll try
        harder.” Or, “I’ll remember to do it.” People inevitably tell me things
        like, “I have a decision journal, but I wish I used it more.” Or, “I
        recorded my workouts for a week, but then quit.” I’ve been there myself.
        I once made a food log to track my calories. I managed to do it for
        <em>one meal</em> and then gave up.
      </p>
      <p>Tracking isn’t for everyone, and there is no need to measure your
        entire life. But nearly anyone can benefit from it in some form—even if
        it’s only temporary.</p>
      <p>What can we do to make tracking easier?</p>
      <p>First, whenever possible, measurement should be automated. You’ll
        probably be surprised by how much you’re already tracking without
        knowing it. Your credit card statement tracks how often you go out to
        eat. Your Fitbit registers how many steps you take and how long you
        sleep. Your calendar records how many new places you travel to each
        year. Once you know where to get the data, add a note to your calendar
        to review it each week or each month, which is more practical than
        tracking it every day.</p>
      <p>Second, manual tracking should be limited to your most important
        <span id="27_16_How_to_Stick_with_.xhtml#page_200" class="pagebreak" title="200"></span>habits. It is better to
        consistently track one habit
        than to sporadically track ten.
      </p>
      <p>Finally, record each measurement immediately after the habit occurs.
        The completion of the behavior is the cue to write it down. This
        approach allows you to combine the habit-stacking method mentioned in
        Chapter 5 with habit tracking.</p>
      <p>The habit stacking + habit tracking formula is:</p>
      <p>After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [TRACK MY HABIT].</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>After I hang up the phone from a sales call, I will move one
            paper clip over.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>After I finish each set at the gym, I will record it in my
            workout journal.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>After I put my plate in the dishwasher, I will write down what I
            ate.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>These tactics can make tracking your habits easier. Even if you
        aren’t the type of person who enjoys recording your behavior, I think
        you’ll find a few weeks of measurements to be insightful. It’s always
        interesting to see how you’ve <em>actually</em> been spending your
        time.</p>
      <p>That said, every habit streak ends at some point. And, more important
        than any single measurement, is having a good plan for when your habits
        slide off track.</p>
      <h3 class="x05-Head-A">HOW TO RECOVER QUICKLY WHEN YOUR HABITS BREAK
        DOWN</h3>
      <p>No matter how consistent you are with your habits, it is inevitable
        that life will interrupt you at some point. Perfection is not possible.
        Before long, an emergency will pop up—you get sick or you have to travel
        for work or your family needs a little more of your time.</p>
      <p><span id="27_16_How_to_Stick_with_.xhtml#page_201" class="pagebreak" title="201"></span>Whenever this happens
        to me, I try to remind myself
        of a simple rule: never miss twice.</p>
      <p>If I miss one day, I try to get back into it as quickly as possible.
        Missing one workout happens, but I’m not going to miss two in a row.
        Maybe I’ll eat an entire pizza, but I’ll follow it up with a healthy
        meal. I can’t be perfect, but I can avoid a second lapse. As soon as one
        streak ends, I get started on the next one.</p>
      <p><span id="27_16_How_to_Stick_with_.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText196"></span>The
        first mistake is never the one that ruins you. It is the spiral of
        repeated mistakes that follows. <span id="27_16_How_to_Stick_with_.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText197"></span>Missing
        once is an accident. Missing twice is the start of a new habit.</p>
      <p>This is a distinguishing feature between winners and losers. Anyone
        can have a bad performance, a bad workout, or a bad day at work. But
        when successful people fail, they rebound quickly. The breaking of a
        habit doesn’t matter if the reclaiming of it is fast.</p>
      <p>I think this principle is so important that I’ll stick to it even if
        I can’t do a habit as well or as completely as I would like. Too often,
        we fall into an all-or-nothing cycle with our habits. The problem is not
        slipping up; the problem is thinking that if you can’t do something
        perfectly, then you shouldn’t do it at all.</p>
      <p>You don’t realize how valuable it is to just show up on your bad (or
        busy) days. Lost days hurt you more than successful days help you. If
        you start with $100, then a 50 percent gain will take you to $150. But
        you only need a 33 percent loss to take you back to $100. In other
        words, avoiding a 33 percent loss is just as valuable as achieving a 50
        percent gain. As Charlie Munger says, “The first rule of compounding:
        Never interrupt it unnecessarily.”</p>
      <p>This is why the “bad” workouts are often the most important ones.
        Sluggish days and bad workouts maintain the compound gains you accrued
        from previous good days. Simply doing something—ten squats, five
        sprints, a push-up, anything really—is huge. Don’t put up a zero. Don’t
        let losses eat into your compounding.</p>
      <p><span id="27_16_How_to_Stick_with_.xhtml#page_202" class="pagebreak" title="202"></span>Furthermore, it’s not
        always about what happens
        during the workout. It’s about being the type of person who doesn’t miss
        workouts. It’s easy to train when you feel good, but it’s crucial to
        show up when you don’t feel like it—even if you do less than you hope.
        Going to the gym for five minutes may not improve your performance, but
        it reaffirms your identity.</p>
      <p>The all-or-nothing cycle of behavior change is just one pitfall that
        can derail your habits. Another potential danger—especially if you are
        using a habit tracker—is measuring the wrong thing.</p>
      <h3 class="x05-Head-A">KNOWING WHEN (AND WHEN NOT) TO TRACK A HABIT</h3>
      <p>Say you’re running a restaurant and you want to know if your chef is
        doing a good job. One way to measure success is to track how many
        customers pay for a meal each day. If more customers come in, the food
        must be good. If fewer customers come in, something must be wrong.</p>
      <p>However, this one measurement—daily revenue—only gives a limited
        picture of what’s really going on. Just because someone pays for a meal
        doesn’t mean they <em>enjoy</em> the meal. Even dissatisfied customers
        are unlikely to dine and dash. In fact, if you’re only measuring
        revenue, the food might be getting worse but you’re making up for it
        with marketing or discounts or some other method. Instead, it may be
        more effective to track how many customers <em>finish</em> their meal or
        perhaps the percentage of customers who leave a generous tip.</p>
      <p>The dark side of tracking a particular behavior is that we become
        driven by the number rather than the purpose behind it. If your success
        is measured by quarterly earnings, you will optimize sales, revenue, and
        accounting for quarterly earnings. If your success is measured by a
        lower number on the scale, you will optimize for a lower number <span
          id="27_16_How_to_Stick_with_.xhtml#page_203" class="pagebreak" title="203"></span>on the scale, even if that
        means embracing crash
        diets, juice cleanses, and fat-loss pills. The human mind wants to “win”
        whatever game is being played.</p>
      <p>This pitfall is evident in many areas of life. We focus on working
        long hours instead of getting meaningful work done. We care more about
        getting ten thousand steps than we do about being healthy. We teach for
        standardized tests instead of emphasizing learning, curiosity, and
        critical thinking. In short, we optimize for what we measure. When we
        choose the wrong measurement, we get the wrong behavior.</p>
      <p>This is sometimes referred to as Goodhart’s Law. Named after the
        economist Charles Goodhart, the principle states, “<span
          id="27_16_How_to_Stick_with_.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText198"></span>When a
        measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.” Measurement
        is only useful when it guides you and adds context to a larger picture,
        not when it consumes you. Each number is simply one piece of feedback in
        the overall system.</p>
      <p>In our data-driven world, we tend to overvalue numbers and undervalue
        anything ephemeral, soft, and difficult to quantify. We mistakenly think
        the factors we can measure are the only factors that exist. But just
        because you can measure something doesn’t mean it’s the most important
        thing. And just because you <em>can’t</em> measure something doesn’t
        mean it’s not important at all.</p>
      <p>All of this to say, it’s crucial to keep habit tracking in its proper
        place. It can feel satisfying to record a habit and track your progress,
        but the measurement is not the only thing that matters. Furthermore,
        there are many ways to measure progress, and sometimes it helps to shift
        your focus to something entirely different.</p>
      <p>This is why <em>nonscale victories</em> can be effective for weight
        loss. The number on the scale may be stubborn, so if you focus solely on
        that number, your motivation will sag. But you may notice that your skin
        looks better or you wake up earlier or your sex drive got a boost. All
        of these are valid ways to track your improvement. If you’re not feeling
        <span id="27_16_How_to_Stick_with_.xhtml#page_204" class="pagebreak" title="204"></span>motivated by the number
        on the scale, perhaps it’s
        time to focus on a different measurement—one that gives you more signals
        of progress.
      </p>
      <p>No matter how you measure your improvement, habit tracking offers a
        simple way to make your habits more satisfying. Each measurement
        provides a little bit of evidence that you’re moving in the right
        direction and a brief moment of immediate pleasure for a job well
        done.</p>

      <p>A<span class="RunIn">FTER SERVING AS </span>a pilot in World War II,
        Roger Fisher attended Harvard Law School and spent thirty-four years
        specializing in negotiation and conflict management. He founded the
        Harvard Negotiation Project and worked with numerous countries and world
        leaders on peace resolutions, hostage crises, and diplomatic
        compromises. But it was in the 1970s and 1980s, as the threat of nuclear
        war escalated, that Fisher developed perhaps his most interesting
        idea.</p>
      <p>At the time, Fisher was focused on designing strategies that could
        prevent nuclear war, and he had noticed a troubling fact. Any sitting
        president would have access to launch codes that could kill millions of
        people but would never actually see anyone die because he would always
        be thousands of miles away.</p>
      <p>“My suggestion was quite simple,” he wrote in 1981. “Put that
        [nuclear] code number in a little capsule, and then implant that capsule
        right next to the heart of a volunteer. The volunteer would carry with
        him a big, heavy butcher knife as he accompanied the President. If ever
        the President wanted to fire nuclear weapons, the only way he could do
        <span id="28_17_How_an_Accountabil.xhtml#page_206" class="pagebreak" title="206"></span>so would be for him
        first, with his own hands, to
        kill one human being. The President says, ‘George, I’m sorry but tens of
        millions must die.’ He has to look at someone and realize what death
        is—what an innocent death is. Blood on the White House carpet. It’s
        reality brought home.
      </p>
      <p>“<span id="28_17_How_an_Accountabil.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText199"></span>When I
        suggested this to friends in the Pentagon they said, ‘My God, that’s
        terrible. Having to kill someone would distort the President’s judgment.
        He might never push the button.’”</p>
      <p>Throughout our discussion of the 4th Law of Behavior Change we have
        covered the importance of making good habits immediately satisfying.
        Fisher’s proposal is an inversion of the 4th Law: <em>Make it
          immediately unsatisfying.</em></p>
      <p>Just as we are more likely to repeat an experience when the ending is
        satisfying, we are also more likely to avoid an experience when the
        ending is painful. Pain is an effective teacher. If a failure is
        painful, it gets fixed. If a failure is relatively painless, it gets
        ignored. The more immediate and more costly a mistake is, the faster you
        will learn from it. The threat of a bad review forces a plumber to be
        good at his job. The possibility of a customer never returning makes
        restaurants create good food. The cost of cutting the wrong blood vessel
        makes a surgeon master human anatomy and cut carefully. When the
        consequences are severe, people learn quickly.</p>
      <p>The more immediate the pain, the less likely the behavior. If you
        want to prevent bad habits and eliminate unhealthy behaviors, then
        adding an instant cost to the action is a great way to reduce their
        odds.</p>
      <p>We repeat bad habits because they serve us in some way, and that
        makes them hard to abandon. The best way I know to overcome this
        predicament is to increase the speed of the punishment associated with
        the behavior. There can’t be a gap between the action and the
        consequences.</p>
      <p><span id="28_17_How_an_Accountabil.xhtml#page_207" class="pagebreak" title="207"></span>As soon as actions
        incur an immediate consequence,
        behavior begins to change. Customers pay their bills on time when they
        are charged a late fee. Students show up to class when their grade is
        linked to attendance. We’ll jump through a lot of hoops to avoid a
        little bit of immediate pain.</p>
      <p>There is, of course, a limit to this. If you’re going to rely on
        punishment to change behavior, then the strength of the punishment must
        match the relative strength of the behavior it is trying to correct. To
        be productive, the cost of procrastination must be greater than the cost
        of action. To be healthy, the cost of laziness must be greater than the
        cost of exercise. Getting fined for smoking in a restaurant or failing
        to recycle adds consequence to an action. Behavior only shifts if the
        punishment is painful enough and reliably enforced.</p>
      <p>In general, the more local, tangible, concrete, and immediate the
        consequence, the more likely it is to influence individual behavior. The
        more global, intangible, vague, and delayed the consequence, the less
        likely it is to influence individual behavior.</p>
      <p>Thankfully, there is a straightforward way to add an immediate cost
        to any bad habit: create a <em>habit contract</em>.</p>
      <h3 class="x05-Head-A">THE HABIT CONTRACT</h3>
      <p><span id="28_17_How_an_Accountabil.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText200"></span>The
        first seat belt law was passed in New York on December 1, 1984. At the
        time, just 14 percent of people in the United States regularly wore a
        seat belt—but that was all about to change.</p>
      <p>Within five years, over half of the nation had seat belt laws. Today,
        <span id="28_17_How_an_Accountabil.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText201"></span>wearing
        a seat belt is enforceable by law in forty-nine of the fifty states. And
        it’s not just the legislation, the number of people wearing seat belts
        has changed dramatically as well. In 2016, <span
          id="28_17_How_an_Accountabil.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText202"></span>over
        88 percent of Americans buckled up each time they got in a car. In just
        over thirty years, there was a complete reversal in the habits of
        millions of people.
      </p>
      <p><span id="28_17_How_an_Accountabil.xhtml#page_208" class="pagebreak" title="208"></span>Laws and regulations
        are an example of how government
        can change our habits by creating a social contract. As a society, we
        collectively agree to abide by certain rules and then enforce them as a
        group. Whenever a new piece of legislation impacts behavior—seat belt
        laws, banning smoking inside restaurants, mandatory recycling—it is an
        example of a social contract shaping our habits. The group agrees to act
        in a certain way, and if you don’t follow along, you’ll be punished.</p>
      <p>Just as governments use laws to hold citizens accountable, you can
        create a habit contract to hold yourself accountable. A habit contract
        is a verbal or written agreement in which you state your commitment to a
        particular habit and the punishment that will occur if you don’t follow
        through. Then you find one or two people to act as your accountability
        partners and sign off on the contract with you.</p>
      <p><span id="28_17_How_an_Accountabil.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText203"></span>Bryan
        Harris, an entrepreneur from Nashville, Tennessee, was the first person
        I saw put this strategy into action. Shortly after the birth of his son,
        Harris realized he wanted to shed a few pounds. He wrote up a habit
        contract between himself, his wife, and his personal trainer. The first
        version read, “Bryan’s #1 objective for Q1 of 2017 is to start eating
        correctly again so he feels better, looks better, and is able to hit his
        long-term goal of 200 pounds at 10% body fat.”</p>
      <p>Below that statement, Harris laid out a road map for achieving his
        ideal outcome:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Phase #1: Get back to a strict “slow-carb” diet in Q1.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Phase #2: Start a strict macronutrient tracking program in
            Q2.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Phase #3: Refine and maintain the details of his diet and workout
            program in Q3.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Finally, he wrote out each of the daily habits that would get him to
        <span id="28_17_How_an_Accountabil.xhtml#page_209" class="pagebreak" title="209"></span>his goal. For example,
        “Write down all food that he
        consumes each day and weigh himself each day.”
      </p>
      <p>And then he listed the punishment if he failed: “If Bryan doesn’t do
        these two items then the following consequence will be enforced: He will
        have to dress up each workday and each Sunday morning for the rest of
        the quarter. Dress up is defined as not wearing jeans, t-shirts,
        hoodies, or shorts. He will also give Joey (his trainer) $200 to use as
        he sees fit if he misses one day of logging food.”</p>
      <p>At the bottom of the page, Harris, his wife, and his trainer all
        signed the contract.</p>
      <p>My initial reaction was that a contract like this seemed overly
        formal and unnecessary, especially the signatures. But Harris convinced
        me that signing the contract was an indication of seriousness. “Anytime
        I skip this part,” he said, “I start slacking almost immediately.”</p>
      <p>Three months later, after hitting his targets for Q1, Harris upgraded
        his goals. The consequences escalated, too. If he missed his
        carbohydrate and protein targets, he had to pay his trainer $100. And if
        he failed to weigh himself, he had to give his wife $500 to use as she
        saw fit. Perhaps most painfully, if he forgot to run sprints, he had to
        dress up for work every day and wear an Alabama hat the rest of the
        quarter—the bitter rival of his beloved Auburn team.</p>
      <p>The strategy worked. With his wife and trainer acting as
        accountability partners and with the habit contract clarifying exactly
        what to do each day, Harris lost the weight.<span id="28_17_How_an_Accountabil.xhtml#footnote-026-backlink"><a
            href="68_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_1" class="_idFootnoteLink noteref" role="doc-noteref">*</a></span></p>
      <p>To make bad habits unsatisfying, your best option is to make them
        painful in the moment. Creating a habit contract is a straightforward
        way to do exactly that.</p>
      <p>Even if you don’t want to create a full-blown habit contract, simply
        <span id="28_17_How_an_Accountabil.xhtml#page_210" class="pagebreak" title="210"></span>having an accountability
        partner is useful. The
        comedian Margaret Cho writes a joke or song every day. <span
          id="28_17_How_an_Accountabil.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText204"></span>She
        does the “song a day” challenge with a friend, which helps them both
        stay accountable. Knowing that someone is watching can be a powerful
        motivator. You are less likely to procrastinate or give up because there
        is an immediate cost. If you don’t follow through, perhaps they’ll see
        you as untrustworthy or lazy. Suddenly, you are not only failing to
        uphold your promises to yourself, but also failing to uphold your
        promises to others.
      </p>
      <p>You can even automate this process. <span
          id="28_17_How_an_Accountabil.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText205"></span>Thomas
        Frank, an entrepreneur in Boulder, Colorado, wakes up at 5:55 each
        morning. And if he doesn’t, he has a tweet automatically scheduled that
        says, “It’s 6:10 and I’m not up because I’m lazy! Reply to this for $5
        via PayPal (limit 5), assuming my alarm didn’t malfunction.”</p>
      <p>We are always trying to present our best selves to the world. We comb
        our hair and brush our teeth and dress ourselves carefully because we
        know these habits are likely to get a positive reaction. We want to get
        good grades and graduate from top schools to impress potential employers
        and mates and our friends and family. We care about the opinions of
        those around us because it helps if others like us. This is precisely
        why getting an accountability partner or signing a habit contract can
        work so well.</p>

    <div class="table">
      <p>The 1st Law: Make It Obvious</p>
      <p><strong>1.1:</strong> Fill out the Habits Scorecard. Write down your
        current habits to become aware of them.</p>
      <p><strong>1.2:</strong> Use implementation intentions: “I will
        [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].”</p>
      <p><strong>1.3:</strong> Use habit stacking: “After [CURRENT HABIT], I
        will [NEW HABIT].”</p>
      <p><strong>1.4:</strong> Design your environment. Make the cues of good
        habits obvious and visible.</p>
      <p>The 2nd Law:Make It Attractive</p>
      <p><strong>2.1:</strong> Use temptation bundling. Pair an action you
        <em>want</em> to do with an action you <em>need</em> to do.
      </p>
      <p><strong>2.2:</strong> Join a culture where your desired behavior is
        the normal behavior.</p>
      <p><strong>2.3:</strong> Create a motivation ritual. Do something you
        enjoy immediately before a difficult habit.</p>
      <p>The 3rd Law: Make It Easy</p>
      <p><strong>3.1:</strong> Reduce friction. Decrease the number of steps
        between you and your good habits.</p>
      <p><strong>3.2:</strong> Prime the environment. Prepare your environment
        to make future actions easier.</p>
      <p><strong>3.3:</strong> Master the decisive moment. Optimize the small
        choices that deliver outsized impact.</p>
      <p><strong>3.4:</strong> Use the Two-Minute Rule. Downscale your habits
        until they can be done in two minutes or less.</p>
      <p><strong>3.5:</strong> Automate your habits. Invest in technology and
        onetime purchases that lock in future behavior.</p>
      <p>The 4th Law: Make It Satisfying</p>
      <p><strong>4.1:</strong> Use reinforcement. Give yourself an immediate
        reward when you complete your habit.</p>
      <p><strong>4.2:</strong> Make “doing nothing” enjoyable. When avoiding a
        bad habit, design a way to see the benefits.</p>
      <p><strong>4.3:</strong> Use a habit tracker. Keep track of your habit
        streak and “don’t break the chain.”</p>
      <p><strong>4.4:</strong> Never miss twice. When you forget to do a
        habit, make sure you get back on track immediately.</p>

        Talent (When Genes Matter and When They Don’t)</h2>
      <p>M<span class="RunIn">ANY PEOPLE ARE </span>familiar with Michael
        Phelps, who is widely considered to be one of the greatest athletes in
        history. <span id="30_18_The_Truth_About_Ta.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText206"></span>Phelps
        has won more Olympic medals not only than any swimmer but also more than
        any Olympian in <em>any</em> sport.</p>
      <p>Fewer people know the name Hicham <span id="30_18_The_Truth_About_Ta.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText207"></span>El
        Guerrouj, but he was a fantastic athlete in his own right. El Guerrouj
        is a Moroccan runner who holds two Olympic gold medals and is one of the
        greatest middle-distance runners of all time. For many years, he held
        the world record in the mile, 1,500-meter, and 2,000-meter races. At the
        Olympic Games in Athens, Greece, in 2004, he won gold in the 1,500-meter
        and 5,000-meter races.</p>
      <p>These two athletes are wildly different in many ways. (For starters,
        one competed on land and the other in water.) But most notably, <span
          id="30_18_The_Truth_About_Ta.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText208"></span>they
        differ significantly in height. El Guerrouj is five feet, nine inches
        tall. Phelps is six feet, four inches tall. Despite this seven-inch
        difference in height, the two men are identical in one respect: Michael
        Phelps and Hicham El Guerrouj wear the <span
          id="30_18_The_Truth_About_Ta.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText209"></span>same
        length inseam on their pants.</p>
      <p><span id="30_18_The_Truth_About_Ta.xhtml#page_218" class="pagebreak" title="218"></span>How is this possible?
        Phelps has relatively short
        legs for his height and a very long torso, the perfect build for
        swimming. El Guerrouj has incredibly long legs and a short upper body,
        an ideal frame for distance running.</p>
      <p>Now, imagine if these world-class athletes were to switch sports.
        Given his remarkable athleticism, could Michael Phelps become an
        Olympic-caliber distance runner with enough training? It’s unlikely. At
        peak fitness, Phelps weighed 194 pounds, which is 40 percent heavier
        than El Guerrouj, who competed at an ultralight 138 pounds. Taller
        runners are heavier runners, and every extra pound is a curse when it
        comes to distance running. Against elite competition, Phelps would be
        doomed from the start.</p>
      <p>Similarly, El Guerrouj might be one of the best runners in history,
        but it’s doubtful he would ever qualify for the Olympics as a swimmer.
        Since 1976, the <span id="30_18_The_Truth_About_Ta.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText210"></span>average
        height of Olympic gold medalists in the men’s 1,500-meter run is five
        feet, ten inches. In comparison, the <span
          id="30_18_The_Truth_About_Ta.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText211"></span>average
        height of Olympic gold medalists in the men’s 100-meter freestyle swim
        is six feet, four inches. Swimmers tend to be tall and have long backs
        and arms, which are ideal for pulling through the water. El Guerrouj
        would be at a severe disadvantage before he ever touched the pool.</p>
      <p>The secret to maximizing your odds of success is to choose the right
        field of competition. This is just as true with habit change as it is
        with sports and business. Habits are easier to perform, and more
        satisfying to stick with, when they align with your natural inclinations
        and abilities. Like Michael Phelps in the pool or Hicham El Guerrouj on
        the track, you want to play a game where the odds are in your favor.</p>
      <p>Embracing this strategy requires the acceptance of the simple truth
        that people are born with different abilities. Some people don’t like to
        discuss this fact. On the surface, your genes seem to be fixed, and it’s
        <span id="30_18_The_Truth_About_Ta.xhtml#page_219" class="pagebreak" title="219"></span>no fun to talk about
        things you cannot control. Plus,
        phrases like <em>biological determinism</em> makes it sound like certain
        individuals are destined for success and others doomed to failure. But
        this is a shortsighted view of the influence of genes on behavior.
      </p>
      <p>The strength of genetics is also their weakness. Genes cannot be
        easily changed, which means they provide a powerful advantage in
        favorable circumstances and a serious disadvantage in unfavorable
        circumstances. If you want to dunk a basketball, being seven feet tall
        is very useful. If you want to perform a gymnastics routine, being seven
        feet tall is a great hindrance. Our environment determines the
        suitability of our genes and the utility of our natural talents. When
        our environment changes, so do the qualities that determine success.</p>
      <p>This is true not just for physical characteristics but for mental
        ones as well. I’m smart if you ask me about habits and human behavior;
        not so much when it comes to knitting, rocket propulsion, or guitar
        chords. Competence is highly dependent on context.</p>
      <p>The people at the top of any competitive field are not only well
        trained, they are also well suited to the task. And this is why, if you
        want to be truly great, selecting the right place to focus is
        crucial.</p>
      <p>In short: genes do not determine your destiny. They determine your
        areas of opportunity. As physician Gabor Mate notes, “<span
          id="30_18_The_Truth_About_Ta.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText212"></span>Genes
        can predispose, but they don’t predetermine.” The areas where you are
        genetically predisposed to success are the areas where habits are more
        likely to be satisfying. The key is to direct your effort toward areas
        that both excite you and match your natural skills, to align your
        ambition with your ability.</p>
      <p>The obvious question is, “How do I figure out where the odds are in
        my favor? How do I identify the opportunities and habits that are right
        for me?” The first place we will look for an answer is by understanding
        your personality.</p>
      <h3 class="x05-Head-A"><span id="30_18_The_Truth_About_Ta.xhtml#page_220" class="pagebreak" title="220"></span>HOW
        YOUR PERSONALITY INFLUENCES YOUR HABITS</h3>
      <p>Your genes are operating beneath the surface of every habit. Indeed,
        beneath the surface of every <em>behavior</em>. <span
          id="30_18_The_Truth_About_Ta.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText213"></span>Genes
        have been shown to influence everything from the number of hours you
        spend watching television to your likelihood to marry or divorce to your
        tendency to get addicted to drugs, alcohol, or nicotine. <span
          id="30_18_The_Truth_About_Ta.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText214"></span>There’s
        a strong genetic component to how obedient or rebellious you are when
        facing authority, how vulnerable or resistant you are to stressful
        events, how proactive or reactive you tend to be, and even how
        captivated or bored you feel during sensory experiences like attending a
        concert. As <span id="30_18_The_Truth_About_Ta.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText215"></span>Robert
        Plomin, a behavioral geneticist at King’s College in London, told me,
        “It is now at the point where we have stopped testing to see if traits
        have a genetic component because we literally can’t find a single one
        that isn’t influenced by our genes.”</p>
      <p>Bundled together, your unique cluster of genetic traits predispose
        you to a particular personality. Your personality is the set of
        characteristics that is consistent from situation to situation. The most
        proven scientific analysis of personality traits is known as the “Big
        Five,” which breaks them down into five spectrums of behavior.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>Openness to experience: from curious and inventive on one end to
            cautious and consistent on the other.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Conscientiousness: organized and efficient to easygoing and
            spontaneous.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Extroversion: outgoing and energetic to solitary and reserved
            (you likely know them as extroverts vs. introverts).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Agreeableness: friendly and compassionate to challenging and
            detached.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Neuroticism: anxious and sensitive to confident, calm, and
            stable.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p><span id="30_18_The_Truth_About_Ta.xhtml#page_221" class="pagebreak" title="221"></span>All five
        characteristics have biological
        underpinnings. Extroversion, for instance, can be tracked from birth. If
        scientists play a loud noise in the nursing ward, some babies turn
        toward it while others turn away. When the researchers tracked these
        children through life, they found that the babies who turned toward the
        noise were more likely to grow up to be extroverts. Those who turned
        away were <span id="30_18_The_Truth_About_Ta.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText216"></span>more
        likely to become introverts.</p>
      <p><span id="30_18_The_Truth_About_Ta.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText217"></span>People
        who are high in agreeableness are kind, considerate, and warm. <span
          id="30_18_The_Truth_About_Ta.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText218"></span>They
        also tend to have higher natural oxytocin levels, a hormone that plays
        an important role in social bonding, increases feelings of trust, and
        can act as a natural antidepressant. You can easily imagine how someone
        with more oxytocin might be inclined to build habits like writing
        thank-you notes or organizing social events.</p>
      <p>As a third example, consider neuroticism, which is a personality
        trait all people possess to various degrees. People who are high in
        neuroticism tend to be anxious and worry more than others. This trait
        has been linked to <span id="30_18_The_Truth_About_Ta.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText219"></span>hypersensitivity
        of the amygdala, the portion of the brain responsible for noticing
        threats. In other words, people who are more sensitive to negative cues
        in their environment are more likely to score high in neuroticism.</p>
      <p>Our habits are not solely determined by our personalities, but there
        is no doubt that our genes nudge us in a certain direction. <span
          id="30_18_The_Truth_About_Ta.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText220"></span>Our
        deeply rooted preferences make certain behaviors easier for some people
        than for others. You don’t have to apologize for these differences or
        feel guilty about them, but you do have to work with them. A person who
        scores lower on conscientiousness, for example, will be less likely to
        be orderly by nature and may need to rely more heavily on environment
        design to stick with good habits. (As a reminder for the less
        conscientious readers among us, environment design is a strategy we
        discussed in Chapters 6 and 12.)</p>
      <p>The takeaway is that you should build habits that work for your <span
          id="30_18_The_Truth_About_Ta.xhtml#page_222" class="pagebreak" title="222"></span>personality.<span
          id="30_18_The_Truth_About_Ta.xhtml#footnote-028-backlink"><a href="69_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_1"
            class="_idFootnoteLink noteref" role="doc-noteref">*</a></span> People can get ripped working out like a
        bodybuilder, but if you prefer rock climbing or cycling or rowing, then
        shape your exercise habit around your interests. <span
          id="30_18_The_Truth_About_Ta.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText221"></span>If
        your friend follows a low-carb diet but you find that low-fat works for
        you, then more power to you. If you want to read more, don’t be
        embarrassed if you prefer steamy romance novels over nonfiction. Read
        whatever fascinates you.<span id="30_18_The_Truth_About_Ta.xhtml#footnote-027-backlink"><a
            href="70_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_2" class="_idFootnoteLink noteref" role="doc-noteref">*</a></span> You
        don’t have to build the habits
        everyone tells you to build. Choose the habit that best suits you, not
        the one that is most popular.</p>
      <p>There is a version of every habit that can bring you joy and
        satisfaction. Find it. Habits need to be enjoyable if they are going to
        stick. This is the core idea behind the 4th Law.</p>
      <p>Tailoring your habits to your personality is a good start, but this
        is not the end of the story. Let’s turn our attention to finding and
        designing situations where you’re at a natural advantage.</p>
      <h3 class="x05-Head-A">HOW TO FIND A GAME WHERE THE ODDS ARE IN YOUR
        FAVOR</h3>
      <p>Learning to play a game where the odds are in your favor is critical
        for maintaining motivation and feeling successful. In theory, you can
        enjoy almost anything. In practice, you are more likely to enjoy the
        things that come easily to you. People who are talented in a particular
        area tend to be more competent at that task and are then praised for
        doing a good job. They stay energized because they are making progress
        where others have failed, and because they get rewarded with better pay
        and bigger opportunities, which not only makes them happier but also
        propels them to produce even higher-quality work. It’s a virtuous
        cycle.</p>
      <p><span id="30_18_The_Truth_About_Ta.xhtml#page_223" class="pagebreak" title="223"></span>Pick the right habit
        and progress is easy. Pick the
        wrong habit and life is a struggle.</p>
      <p>How do you pick the right habit? The first step is something we
        covered in the 3rd Law: <em>make it easy</em>. In many cases, when
        people pick the wrong habit, it simply means they picked a habit that
        was too difficult. When a habit is easy, you are more likely to be
        successful. When you are successful, you are more likely to feel
        satisfied. However, there is another level to consider. In the long-run,
        if you continue to advance and improve, any area can become challenging.
        At some point, you need to make sure you’re playing the right game for
        your skillset. How do you figure that out?</p>
      <p>The most common approach is trial and error. Of course, there’s a
        problem with this strategy: life is short. You don’t have time to try
        every career, date every eligible bachelor, or play every musical
        instrument. Thankfully, there is an effective way to manage this
        conundrum, and it is known as the <span
          id="30_18_The_Truth_About_Ta.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText222"></span><em>explore/exploit
          trade-off</em>.</p>
      <p>In the beginning of a new activity, there should be a period of
        exploration. In relationships, it’s called dating. In college, it’s
        called the liberal arts. In business, it’s called split testing. The
        goal is to try out many possibilities, research a broad range of ideas,
        and cast a wide net.</p>
      <p>After this initial period of exploration, shift your focus to the
        best solution you’ve found—but keep experimenting occasionally. The
        proper balance depends on whether you’re winning or losing. If you are
        currently winning, you exploit, exploit, exploit. If you are currently
        losing, you continue to explore, explore, explore.</p>
      <p>In the long-run it is probably most effective to work on the strategy
        that seems to deliver the best results about 80 to 90 percent of the
        time and keep exploring with the remaining 10 to 20 percent. <span
          id="30_18_The_Truth_About_Ta.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText223"></span>Google
        famously asks employees to spend 80 percent of the workweek on their
        official job and 20 percent on projects of their choice, which has led
        to the creation of blockbuster products like AdWords and Gmail.</p>
      <p><span id="30_18_The_Truth_About_Ta.xhtml#page_224" class="pagebreak" title="224"></span>The optimal approach
        also depends on how much time
        you have. If you have a lot of time—like someone at the beginning of
        their career—it makes more sense to explore because once you find the
        right thing, you still have a good amount of time to exploit it. If
        you’re pressed for time—say, as you come up on the deadline for a
        project—you should implement the best solution you’ve found so far and
        get some results.</p>
      <p>As you explore different options, there are a series of questions you
        can ask yourself to continually narrow in on the habits and areas that
        will be most satisfying to you:</p>
      <div class="list" role="list">
        <p><strong>What feels like fun to me, but work to others?</strong> The
          mark of whether you are made for a task is not whether you love it but
          whether you can handle the pain of the task easier than most people.
          When are you enjoying yourself while other people are complaining? The
          work that hurts you less than it hurts others is the work you were made
          to do.</p>
        <p><strong>What makes me lose track of time? <span
              id="30_18_The_Truth_About_Ta.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText224"></span></strong>Flow
          is the mental state you enter when you are so focused on the task at
          hand that the rest of the world fades away. This blend of happiness and
          peak performance is what athletes and performers experience when they
          are “in the zone.” It is nearly impossible to experience a flow state
          and not find the task satisfying at least to some degree.</p>
        <p><strong>Where do I get greater returns than the average
            person?</strong> We are continually comparing ourselves to those around
          us, and a behavior is more likely to be satisfying when the comparison
          is in our favor. When I started writing at jamesclear.com, my email list
          grew very quickly. I wasn’t quite sure what I was doing well, but I knew
          that results seemed to be coming faster for me than for some of my
          colleagues, which motivated me to keep writing.</p>
        <p><strong><span id="30_18_The_Truth_About_Ta.xhtml#page_225" class="pagebreak" title="225"></span>What comes
            naturally to
            me?</strong> For just a moment, ignore what you have been taught. Ignore
          what society has told you. Ignore what others expect of you. Look inside
          yourself and ask, “What feels natural to me? When have I felt alive?
          When have I felt like the real me?” No internal judgments or
          people-pleasing. No second-guessing or self-criticism. Just feelings of
          engagement and enjoyment. Whenever you feel authentic and genuine, you
          are headed in the right direction.</p>
      </div>
      <p>To be honest, some of this process is just luck. Michael Phelps and
        Hicham El Guerrouj were lucky to be born with a rare set of abilities
        that are highly valued by society and to be placed in the ideal
        environment for those abilities. We all have limited time on this
        planet, and the truly great among us are the ones who not only work hard
        but also have the good fortune to be exposed to opportunities that favor
        us.</p>
      <p>But what if you don’t want to leave it up to luck?</p>
      <p>If you can’t find a game where the odds are stacked in your favor,
        create one. Scott Adams, the cartoonist behind <em>Dilbert</em>, says,
        “<span id="30_18_The_Truth_About_Ta.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText225"></span>Everyone
        has at least a few areas in which they could be in the top 25% with some
        effort. In my case, I can draw better than most people, but I’m hardly
        an artist. And I’m not any funnier than the average standup comedian who
        never makes it big, but I’m funnier than most people. The magic is that
        few people can draw well and write jokes. It’s the combination of the
        two that makes what I do so rare. And when you add in my business
        background, suddenly I had a topic that few cartoonists could hope to
        understand without living it.”</p>
      <p>When you can’t win by being better, you can win by being different.
        By combining your skills, you reduce the level of competition, which
        makes it easier to stand out. You can shortcut the need for a genetic
        advantage (or for years of practice) by rewriting the rules. A good
        player works hard to win the game everyone else is playing. A great
        <span id="30_18_The_Truth_About_Ta.xhtml#page_226" class="pagebreak" title="226"></span>player creates a new
        game that favors their strengths
        and avoids their weaknesses.
      </p>
      <p>In college, I designed my own major, biomechanics, which was a
        combination of physics, chemistry, biology, and anatomy. I wasn’t smart
        enough to stand out among the top physics or biology majors, so I
        created my own game. And because it suited me—I was only taking the
        courses I was interested in—studying felt like less of a chore. It was
        also easier to avoid the trap of comparing myself to everyone else.
        After all, nobody else was taking the same combination of classes, so
        who could say if they were better or worse?</p>
      <p>Specialization is a powerful way to overcome the “accident” of bad
        genetics. The more you master a specific skill, the harder it becomes
        for others to compete with you. Many bodybuilders are stronger than the
        average arm wrestler, but even a massive bodybuilder may lose at arm
        wrestling because the arm wrestling champ has very specific strength.
        Even if you’re not the most naturally gifted, you can often win by being
        the best in a very narrow category.</p>
      <p>Boiling water will soften a potato but harden an egg. You can’t
        control whether you’re a potato or an egg, but you can decide to play a
        game where it’s better to be hard or soft. If you can find a more
        favorable environment, you can transform the situation from one where
        the odds are against you to one where they are in your favor.</p>
      <h3 class="x05-Head-A">HOW TO GET THE MOST OUT OF YOUR GENES</h3>
      <p>Our genes do not eliminate the need for hard work. They clarify it.
        They tell us <em>what</em> to work hard on. Once we realize our
        strengths, we know where to spend our time and energy. We know which
        types of opportunities to look for and which types of challenges to
        avoid. The better we understand our nature, the better our strategy can
        be.</p>
      <p>Biological differences matter. Even so, it’s more productive to focus
        <span id="30_18_The_Truth_About_Ta.xhtml#page_227" class="pagebreak" title="227"></span>on whether you are
        fulfilling your own potential than
        comparing yourself to someone else. The fact that you have a natural
        limit to any specific ability has nothing to do with whether you are
        reaching the ceiling of your capabilities. People get so caught up in
        the fact that they <em>have</em> limits that they rarely exert the
        effort required to get close to them.
      </p>
      <p>Furthermore, genes can’t make you successful if you’re not doing the
        work. Yes, it’s possible that the ripped trainer at the gym has better
        genes, but if you haven’t put in the same reps, it’s impossible to say
        if you have been dealt a better or worse genetic hand. Until you work as
        hard as those you admire, don’t explain away their success as luck.</p>
      <p>In summary, one of the best ways to ensure your habits remain
        satisfying over the long-run is to pick behaviors that align with your
        personality and skills. Work hard on the things that come easy.</p>

        How to Stay Motivated in Life and Work</h2>
      <p>I<span class="RunIn">N 1955</span>, Disneyland had just opened in
        Anaheim, California, when a ten-year-old boy walked in and asked for a
        job. Labor laws were loose back then and the boy managed to land a
        position selling guidebooks for $0.50 apiece.</p>
      <p>Within a year, he had transitioned to Disney’s magic shop, where he
        learned tricks from the older employees. He experimented with jokes and
        tried out simple routines on visitors. Soon he discovered that what he
        loved was not performing magic but performing in general. He set his
        sights on becoming a comedian.</p>
      <p>Beginning in his teenage years, he started performing in little clubs
        around Los Angeles. The crowds were small and his act was short. He was
        rarely on stage for more than five minutes. Most of the people in the
        crowd were too busy drinking or talking with friends to pay attention.
        One night, he literally delivered his stand-up routine to an empty
        club.</p>
      <p><span id="31_19_The_Goldilocks_Rul.xhtml#page_230" class="pagebreak" title="230"></span>It wasn’t glamorous
        work, but there was no doubt he
        was getting better. His first routines would only last one or two
        minutes. By high school, his material had expanded to include a
        five-minute act and, a few years later, a ten-minute show. At nineteen,
        he was performing weekly for twenty minutes at a time. He had to read
        three poems during the show just to make the routine long enough, but
        his skills continued to progress.</p>
      <p>He spent another decade experimenting, adjusting, and practicing. He
        took a job as a television writer and, gradually, he was able to land
        his own appearances on talk shows. By the mid-1970s, he had worked his
        way into being a regular guest on <em>The Tonight Show</em> and
        <em>Saturday Night Live</em>.
      </p>
      <p>Finally, after nearly fifteen years of work, the young man rose to
        fame. He toured sixty cities in sixty-three days. Then seventy-two
        cities in eighty days. Then eighty-five cities in ninety days. He had
        18,695 people attend one show in Ohio. Another 45,000 tickets were sold
        for his three-day show in New York. He catapulted to the top of his
        genre and became one of the <span id="31_19_The_Goldilocks_Rul.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText226"></span>most
        successful comedians of his time.</p>
      <p>His name is Steve Martin.</p>
      <p>Martin’s story offers a fascinating perspective on what it takes to
        stick with habits for the long run. Comedy is not for the timid. It is
        hard to imagine a situation that would strike fear into the hearts of
        more people than performing alone on stage and failing to get a single
        laugh. And yet Steve Martin faced this fear every week for eighteen
        years. In his words, “10 years spent learning, 4 years spent refining,
        and <span id="31_19_The_Goldilocks_Rul.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText227"></span>4
        years as a wild success.”</p>
      <p>Why is it that some people, like Martin, stick with their
        habits—whether practicing jokes or drawing cartoons or playing
        guitar—while most of us struggle to stay motivated? How do we design
        habits that pull us in rather than ones that fade away? Scientists have
        been <span id="31_19_The_Goldilocks_Rul.xhtml#page_231" class="pagebreak" title="231"></span>studying this
        question for many
        years. While there is still much to learn, one of the most consistent
        findings is that the way to maintain motivation and achieve peak levels
        of desire is to work on tasks of “<span id="31_19_The_Goldilocks_Rul.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText228"></span>just
        manageable difficulty.”</p>
      <p>The human brain loves a challenge, but only if it is within an
        optimal zone of difficulty. If you love tennis and try to play a serious
        match against a four-year-old, you will quickly become bored. It’s too
        easy. You’ll win every point. In contrast, if you play a professional
        tennis player like Roger Federer or Serena Williams, you will quickly
        lose motivation because the match is too difficult.</p>
      <p>Now consider playing tennis against someone who is your equal. As the
        game progresses, you win a few points and you lose a few. You have a
        good chance of winning, but only if you really try. Your focus narrows,
        distractions fade away, and you find yourself fully invested in the task
        at hand. This is a challenge of just manageable difficulty and it is a
        prime example of the <em>Goldilocks Rule</em>.</p>
      <p>The Goldilocks Rule states that humans experience peak motivation
        when working on tasks that are right on the edge of their current
        abilities. Not too hard. Not too easy. Just right.</p>

      <p>Martin’s comedy career is an excellent example of the Goldilocks Rule
        in practice. Each year, he expanded his comedy routine—but only by a
        minute or two. He was always adding new material, but he also kept a few
        jokes that were guaranteed to get laughs. There were just enough
        victories to keep him motivated and just enough mistakes to keep him
        working hard.</p>
      <p>When you’re starting a new habit, it’s important to keep the behavior
        as easy as possible so you can stick with it even when conditions aren’t
        perfect. This is an idea we covered in detail while discussing the 3rd
        Law of Behavior Change.</p>
      <p>Once a habit has been established, however, it’s important to
        continue to advance in small ways. These little improvements and new
        <span id="31_19_The_Goldilocks_Rul.xhtml#page_232" class="pagebreak" title="232"></span>challenges keep you
        engaged. And if you hit the
        Goldilocks Zone just right, you can achieve a <em>flow state</em>.<span
          id="31_19_The_Goldilocks_Rul.xhtml#footnote-030-backlink"><a href="71_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_1"
            class="_idFootnoteLink noteref" role="doc-noteref">*</a></span>
      </p>
      <p><span id="31_19_The_Goldilocks_Rul.xhtml#page_233" class="pagebreak" title="233"></span>A flow state is the
        experience of being “in the zone”
        and fully immersed in an activity. Scientists have tried to quantify
        this feeling. They found that to achieve a state of flow, a task must be
        roughly <span id="31_19_The_Goldilocks_Rul.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText230"></span>4
        percent beyond your current ability. In real life it’s typically not
        feasible to quantify the difficulty of an action in this way, but the
        core idea of the Goldilocks Rule remains: working on challenges of just
        manageable difficulty—something on the perimeter of your ability—seems
        crucial for maintaining motivation.</p>
      <p>Improvement requires a delicate balance. You need to regularly search
        for challenges that push you to your edge while continuing to make
        enough progress to stay motivated. Behaviors need to remain novel in
        order for them to stay attractive and satisfying. Without variety, we
        get bored. And boredom is perhaps the greatest villain on the quest for
        self-improvement.</p>
      <h3 class="x05-Head-A">HOW TO STAY FOCUSED WHEN YOU GET BORED WORKING ON
        YOUR GOALS</h3>
      <p>After my baseball career ended, I was looking for a new sport. I
        joined a weightlifting team and one day an elite coach visited our gym.
        He had worked with thousands of athletes during his long career,
        including a few Olympians. I introduced myself and we began talking
        about the process of improvement.</p>
      <p>“What’s the difference between the best athletes and everyone else?”
        I asked. “What do the really successful people do that most don’t?”</p>
      <p>He mentioned the factors you might expect: genetics, luck, talent.
        But then he said something I wasn’t expecting: “At some point it comes
        down to who can handle the boredom of training every day, doing the same
        lifts over and over and over.”</p>
      <p>His answer surprised me because it’s a different way of thinking
        <span id="31_19_The_Goldilocks_Rul.xhtml#page_234" class="pagebreak" title="234"></span>about work ethic. People
        talk about getting “amped
        up” to work on their goals. Whether it’s business or sports or art, you
        hear people say things like, “It all comes down to passion.” Or, “You
        have to really want it.” As a result, many of us get depressed when we
        lose focus or motivation because we think that successful people have
        some bottomless reserve of passion. But this coach was saying that
        really successful people <em>feel</em> the same lack of motivation as
        everyone else. The difference is that they still find a way to show up
        despite the feelings of boredom.
      </p>
      <p>Mastery requires practice. But the more you practice something, the
        more boring and routine it becomes. Once the beginner gains have been
        made and we learn what to expect, our interest starts to fade. Sometimes
        it happens even faster than that. All you have to do is hit the gym a
        few days in a row or publish a couple of blog posts on time and letting
        one day slip doesn’t feel like much. Things are going well. It’s easy to
        rationalize taking a day off because you’re in a good place.</p>
      <p>The greatest threat to success is not failure but boredom. We get
        bored with habits because they stop delighting us. The outcome becomes
        expected. And as our habits become ordinary, we start derailing our
        progress to seek novelty. Perhaps this is why we get caught up in a
        never-ending cycle, jumping from one workout to the next, one diet to
        the next, one business idea to the next. As soon as we experience the
        slightest dip in motivation, we begin seeking a new strategy—even if the
        old one was still working. As Machiavelli noted, “<span
          id="31_19_The_Goldilocks_Rul.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText231"></span>Men
        desire novelty to such an extent that those who are doing well wish for
        a change as much as those who are doing badly.”</p>
      <p>Perhaps this is why many of the most habit-forming products are those
        that provide continuous forms of novelty. Video games provide visual
        novelty. Porn provides sexual novelty. Junk foods provide culinary
        novelty. Each of these experiences offer continual elements of
        surprise.</p>
      <p><span id="31_19_The_Goldilocks_Rul.xhtml#page_235" class="pagebreak" title="235"></span>In psychology, this is
        known as a <span id="31_19_The_Goldilocks_Rul.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText232"></span><em>variable
          reward</em>.<span id="31_19_The_Goldilocks_Rul.xhtml#footnote-029-backlink"><a
            href="72_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_2" class="_idFootnoteLink noteref" role="doc-noteref">*</a></span> Slot
        machines are the most common
        real-world example. A gambler hits the jackpot every now and then but
        not at any predictable interval. The pace of rewards varies. <span
          id="31_19_The_Goldilocks_Rul.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText233"></span>This
        variance leads to the greatest spike of dopamine, enhances memory
        recall, and accelerates habit formation.</p>
      <p>Variable rewards won’t <em>create</em> a craving—that is, you can’t
        take a reward people are uninterested in, give it to them at a variable
        interval, and hope it will change their mind—but they are a powerful way
        to amplify the cravings we already experience because they reduce
        boredom.</p>
      <p>The sweet spot of desire occurs at a 50/50 split between success and
        failure. Half of the time you get what you want. Half of the time you
        don’t. You need just enough “winning” to experience satisfaction and
        just enough “wanting” to experience desire. This is one of the benefits
        of following the Goldilocks Rule. If you’re already interested in a
        habit, working on challenges of just manageable difficulty is a good way
        to keep things interesting.</p>
      <p>Of course, not all habits have a variable reward component, and you
        wouldn’t want them to. If Google only delivered a useful search result
        some of the time, I would switch to a competitor pretty quickly. If Uber
        only picked up half of my trips, I doubt I’d be using that service much
        longer. And if I flossed my teeth each night and only sometimes ended up
        with a clean mouth, I think I’d skip it.</p>
      <p>Variable rewards or not, no habit will stay interesting forever. At
        some point, everyone faces the same challenge on the journey of
        self-improvement: you have to fall in love with boredom.</p>
      <p>We all have goals that we would like to achieve and dreams that we
        <span id="31_19_The_Goldilocks_Rul.xhtml#page_236" class="pagebreak" title="236"></span>would like to fulfill,
        but it doesn’t matter what you
        are trying to become better at, if you only do the work when it’s
        convenient or exciting, then you’ll never be consistent enough to
        achieve remarkable results.
      </p>
      <p>I can guarantee that if you manage to start a habit and keep sticking
        to it, there will be days when you feel like quitting. When you start a
        business, there will be days when you don’t feel like showing up. When
        you’re at the gym, there will be sets that you don’t feel like
        finishing. When it’s time to write, there will be days that you don’t
        feel like typing. But stepping up when it’s annoying or painful or
        draining to do so, that’s what makes the difference between a
        professional and an amateur.</p>
      <p>Professionals stick to the schedule; amateurs let life get in the
        way. Professionals know what is important to them and work toward it
        with purpose; amateurs get pulled off course by the urgencies of
        life.</p>
      <p>David Cain, an author and meditation teacher, encourages his students
        to avoid being “fair-weather meditators.” Similarly, you don’t want to
        be a fair-weather athlete or a fair-weather writer or a fair-weather
        anything. When a habit is truly important to you, you have to be willing
        to stick to it in any mood. Professionals take action even when the mood
        isn’t right. They might not enjoy it, but they find a way to put the
        reps in.</p>
      <p>There have been a lot of sets that I haven’t felt like finishing, but
        I’ve never regretted doing the workout. There have been a lot of
        articles I haven’t felt like writing, but I’ve never regretted
        publishing on schedule. There have been a lot of days I’ve felt like
        relaxing, but I’ve never regretted showing up and working on something
        that was important to me.</p>
      <p>The only way to become excellent is to be endlessly fascinated by
        doing the same thing over and over. You have to fall in love with
        boredom.</p>

        chess, it is only after the basic movements of the pieces have become
        automatic that a player can focus on the next level of the game. Each
        chunk of information that is memorized opens up the mental space for
        more effortful thinking. This is true for any endeavor. When you know
        the simple movements so well that you can perform them without thinking,
        you are free to pay attention to more advanced details. In this way,
        habits are the backbone of any pursuit of excellence.
      </p>
      <p>However, the benefits of habits come at a cost. At first, each
        repetition develops fluency, speed, and skill. But then, as a habit
        becomes automatic, you become less sensitive to feedback. You fall into
        mindless repetition. It becomes easier to let mistakes slide. When you
        can do it “good enough” on autopilot, you stop thinking about how to do
        it better.</p>
      <p>The upside of habits is that we can do things without thinking. The
        downside of habits is that you get used to doing things a certain way
        and stop paying attention to little errors. You assume you’re getting
        better because you’re gaining experience. In reality, you are merely
        <span id="32_20_The_Downside_of_Cr.xhtml#page_240" class="pagebreak" title="240"></span>reinforcing your current
        habits—not improving them.
        In fact, some research has shown that once a skill has been mastered
        <span id="32_20_The_Downside_of_Cr.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText234"></span>there
        is usually a slight <em>decline</em> in performance over time.
      </p>
      <p>Usually, this minor dip in performance is no cause for worry. You
        don’t need a system to continuously improve how well you brush your
        teeth or tie your shoes or make your morning cup of tea. With habits
        like these, good enough is usually good enough. The less energy you
        spend on trivial choices, the more you can spend it on what really
        matters.</p>
      <p>However, when you want to maximize your potential and achieve elite
        levels of performance, you need a more nuanced approach. You can’t
        repeat the same things blindly and expect to become exceptional. Habits
        are necessary, but not sufficient for mastery. What you need is a
        combination of automatic habits and deliberate practice.</p>
      <p>Habits + Deliberate Practice = Mastery</p>
      <p>To become great, certain skills <em>do</em> need to become automatic.
        Basketball players need to be able to dribble without thinking before
        they can move on to mastering layups with their nondominant hand.
        Surgeons need to repeat the first incision so many times that they could
        do it with their eyes closed, so that they can focus on the hundreds of
        variables that arise during surgery. But after one habit has been
        mastered, you have to return to the effortful part of the work and begin
        building the next habit.</p>
      <p>Mastery is the process of narrowing your focus to a tiny element of
        success, repeating it until you have internalized the skill, and then
        using this new habit as the foundation to advance to the next frontier
        of your development. Old tasks become easier the second time around, but
        it doesn’t get easier overall because now you’re pouring your energy
        into the next challenge. Each habit unlocks the next level of

      <p>Although habits are powerful, what you need is a way to remain
        conscious of your performance over time, so you can continue to <span
          id="32_20_The_Downside_of_Cr.xhtml#page_242" class="pagebreak" title="242"></span>refine and improve. It is
        precisely at the moment
        when you begin to feel like you have mastered a skill—right when things
        are starting to feel automatic and you are becoming comfortable—that you
        must avoid slipping into the trap of complacency.</p>
      <p>The solution? Establish a system for reflection and review.</p>
      <h3 class="x05-Head-A">HOW TO REVIEW YOUR HABITS AND MAKE
        ADJUSTMENTS</h3>
      <p>In 1986, the Los Angeles Lakers had one of the most talented
        basketball teams ever assembled, but they are rarely remembered that
        way. The team started the 1985–1986 NBA season with an astounding 29–5
        record. “<span id="32_20_The_Downside_of_Cr.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText235"></span>The
        pundits were saying that we might be the best team in the history of
        basketball,” head coach Pat Riley said after the season. Surprisingly,
        the Lakers stumbled in the 1986 playoffs and suffered a season-ending
        defeat in the Western Conference Finals. The “best team in the history
        of basketball” didn’t even play for the NBA championship.</p>
      <p>After that blow, Riley was tired of hearing about how much talent his
        players had and about how much promise his team held. He didn’t want to
        see flashes of brilliance followed by a gradual fade in performance. He
        wanted the Lakers to play up to their potential, night after night. In
        the summer of 1986, he created a plan to do exactly that, <span
          id="32_20_The_Downside_of_Cr.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText236"></span>a
        system that he called the Career Best Effort program or CBE.</p>
      <p>“When players first join the Lakers,” Riley explained, “we track
        their basketball statistics all the way back to high school. I call this
        Taking Their Number. We look for an accurate gauge of what a player can
        do, then build him into our plan for the team, based on the notion that
        he will maintain and then improve upon his averages.”</p>
      <p>After determining a player’s baseline level of performance, Riley
        added a key step. He asked each player to “improve their output by at
        <span id="32_20_The_Downside_of_Cr.xhtml#page_243" class="pagebreak" title="243"></span>least 1 percent over the
        course of the season. <span id="32_20_The_Downside_of_Cr.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText237"></span>If
        they succeeded, it would be a CBE, or Career Best Effort.” Similar to
        the British Cycling team that we discussed in Chapter 1, the Lakers
        sought peak performance by getting slightly better each day.
      </p>
      <p>Riley was careful to point out that CBE was not merely about points
        or statistics but about giving your “best effort spiritually and
        mentally and physically.” Players got credit for “allowing an opponent
        to run into you when you know that a foul will be called against him,
        diving for loose balls, going after rebounds whether you are likely to
        get them or not, helping a teammate when the player he’s guarding has
        surged past him, and other ‘unsung hero’ deeds.”</p>
      <p>As an example, let’s say that Magic Johnson—the Lakers star player at
        the time—had 11 points, 8 rebounds, 12 assists, 2 steals, and 5
        turnovers in a game. Magic also got credit for an “unsung hero” deed by
        diving after a loose ball (+1). Finally, he played a total of 33 minutes
        in this imaginary game.</p>
      <p>The positive numbers (11 + 8 + 12 + 2 + 1) add up to 34. Then, we
        subtract the 5 turnovers (34–5) to get 29. Finally, we divide 29 by 33
        minutes played.</p>
      <p>29/33 = 0.879</p>
      <p>Magic’s CBE number here would be 879. This number was calculated for
        all of a player’s games, and it was the average CBE that a player was
        asked to improve by 1 percent over the season. Riley compared each
        player’s current CBE to not only their past performances but also those
        of other players in the league. As Riley put it, “We rank team members
        alongside league opponents who play the same position and have similar
        role definitions.”</p>
      <p>Sportswriter Jackie MacMullan noted, “Riley trumpeted the top
        performers in the league in bold lettering on the blackboard each week
        <span id="32_20_The_Downside_of_Cr.xhtml#page_244" class="pagebreak" title="244"></span>and measured them
        against the corresponding players
        on his own roster. Solid, reliable players generally rated a score in
        the 600s, while elite players scored at least 800. Magic Johnson, who
        submitted 138 triple-doubles in his career, often scored over
        1,000.”
      </p>
      <p>The Lakers also emphasized year-over-year progress by making
        historical comparisons of CBE data. Riley said, “We stacked the month of
        November 1986, next to November 1985, and showed the players whether
        they were doing better or worse than at the same point last season. Then
        we showed them how their performance figures for December 1986, stacked
        up against November’s.”</p>
      <p>The Lakers rolled out CBE in October 1986. Eight months later, they
        were NBA champions. The following year, Pat Riley led his team to
        another title as the Lakers became the first team in twenty years to win
        back-to-back NBA championships. Afterward, he said, “<span
          id="32_20_The_Downside_of_Cr.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText238"></span>Sustaining
        an effort is the most important thing for any enterprise. The way to be
        successful is to learn how to do things right, then do them the same way
        every time.”</p>
      <p>The CBE program is a prime example of the power of reflection and
        review. The Lakers were already talented. CBE helped them get the most
        out of what they had, and made sure their habits improved rather than
        declined.</p>
      <p>Reflection and review enables the long-term improvement of all habits
        because it makes you aware of your mistakes and helps you consider
        possible paths for improvement. Without reflection, we can make excuses,
        create rationalizations, and lie to ourselves. We have no process for
        determining whether we are performing better or worse compared to
        yesterday.</p>
      <p>Top performers in all fields engage in various types of reflection
        and review, and the process doesn’t have to be complex. Kenyan runner
        <span id="32_20_The_Downside_of_Cr.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText239"></span>Eliud
        Kipchoge is one of the greatest marathoners of all time and an Olympic
        gold medalist. He still takes notes after every practice in <span id="32_20_The_Downside_of_Cr.xhtml#page_245"
          class="pagebreak" title="245"></span>which he reviews his training for the day and
        searches for areas that can be improved. Similarly, gold medal swimmer
        Katie Ledecky records her wellness on a scale of 1 to 10 and includes
        notes on her nutrition and how well she slept. She also records the
        times posted by other swimmers. At the end of each week, <span
          id="32_20_The_Downside_of_Cr.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText240"></span>her
        coach goes over her notes and adds his thoughts.
      </p>
      <p>It’s not just athletes, either. <span id="32_20_The_Downside_of_Cr.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText241"></span>When
        comedian Chris Rock is preparing fresh material, he will first appear at
        small nightclubs dozens of times and test hundreds of jokes. He brings a
        notepad on stage and records which bits go over well and where he needs
        to make adjustments. The few killer lines that survive will form the
        backbone of his new show.</p>
      <p>I know of executives and investors who keep a “decision journal” in
        which they record the major decisions they make each week, why they made
        them, and what they expect the outcome to be. They review their choices
        at the end of each month or year to see where they were correct and
        where they went wrong.<span id="32_20_The_Downside_of_Cr.xhtml#footnote-033-backlink"><a
            href="73_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_1" class="_idFootnoteLink noteref" role="doc-noteref">*</a></span></p>
      <p>Improvement is not just about learning habits, it’s also about
        fine-tuning them. Reflection and review ensures that you spend your time
        on the right things and make course corrections whenever necessary—like
        Pat Riley adjusting the effort of his players on a nightly basis. You
        don’t want to keep practicing a habit if it becomes ineffective.</p>
      <p>Personally, I employ two primary modes of reflection and review. Each
        December, I perform an <span id="32_20_The_Downside_of_Cr.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText242"></span><em>Annual
          Review</em>, in which I reflect on the previous year. I tally my habits
        for the year by counting up how many articles I published, how many
        workouts I put in, how many new places I visited, and more.<span
          id="32_20_The_Downside_of_Cr.xhtml#footnote-032-backlink"><a href="74_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_2"
            class="_idFootnoteLink noteref" role="doc-noteref">*</a></span> Then, I reflect on my progress (or lack
        thereof) by answering three questions:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p><span id="32_20_The_Downside_of_Cr.xhtml#page_246" class="pagebreak" title="246"></span>What went well this
            year?</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>What didn’t go so well this year?</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>What did I learn?</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>Six months later, when summer rolls around, I conduct an
        <em>Integrity Report</em>. Like everyone, I make a lot of mistakes. My
        Integrity Report helps me realize where I went wrong and motivates me to
        get back on course. I use it as a time to revisit my core values and
        consider whether I have been living in accordance with them. This is
        when I reflect on my identity and how I can work toward being the type
        of person I wish to become.<span id="32_20_The_Downside_of_Cr.xhtml#footnote-031-backlink"><a
            href="75_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_3" class="_idFootnoteLink noteref" role="doc-noteref">*</a></span>
      </p>
      <p>My yearly Integrity Report answers three questions:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>What are the core values that drive my life and work?</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>How am I living and working with integrity right now?</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>How can I set a higher standard in the future?</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>These two reports don’t take very long—just a few hours per year—but
        they are crucial periods of refinement. They prevent the gradual slide
        that happens when I don’t pay close attention. They provide an annual
        reminder to revisit my desired identity and consider how my habits are
        helping me become the type of person I wish to be. They indicate when I
        should upgrade my habits and take on new challenges and when I should
        dial my efforts back and focus on the fundamentals.</p>
      <p>Reflection can also bring a sense of perspective. Daily habits are
        powerful because of how they compound, but worrying too much about every
        daily choice is like looking at yourself in the mirror from an inch
        away. You can see every imperfection and lose sight of the <span id="32_20_The_Downside_of_Cr.xhtml#page_247"
          class="pagebreak" title="247"></span>bigger picture. There is too much feedback.
        Conversely, never reviewing your habits is like never looking in the
        mirror. You aren’t aware of easily fixable flaws—a spot on your shirt, a
        bit of food in your teeth. There is too little feedback. Periodic
        reflection and review is like viewing yourself in the mirror from a
        conversational distance. You can see the important changes you should
        make without losing sight of the bigger picture. You want to view the
        entire mountain range, not obsess over each peak and valley.</p>
      <p>Finally, reflection and review offers an ideal time to revisit one of
        the most important aspects of behavior change: identity.</p>
      <h3 class="x05-Head-A">HOW TO BREAK THE BELIEFS THAT HOLD YOU BACK</h3>
      <p>In the beginning, repeating a habit is essential to build up evidence
        of your desired identity. As you latch on to that new identity, however,
        those same beliefs can hold you back from the next level of growth. When
        working against you, your identity creates a kind of “pride” that
        encourages you to deny your weak spots and prevents you from truly
        growing. This is one of the greatest downsides of building habits.</p>
      <p>The more sacred an idea is to us—that is, the more deeply it is tied
        to our identity—the more strongly we will defend it against criticism.
        You see this in every industry. The schoolteacher who ignores innovative
        teaching methods and sticks with her tried-and-true lesson plans. The
        veteran manager who is committed to doing things “his way.” The surgeon
        who dismisses the ideas of her younger colleagues. The band who produces
        a mind-blowing first album and then gets stuck in a rut. The tighter we
        cling to an identity, the harder it becomes to grow beyond it.</p>
      <p>One solution is to avoid making any single aspect of your identity an
        overwhelming portion of who you are. In the words of investor Paul <span
          id="32_20_The_Downside_of_Cr.xhtml#page_248" class="pagebreak" title="248"></span>Graham, “<span
          id="32_20_The_Downside_of_Cr.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText243"></span>keep
        your identity small.” The more you let a single belief define you, the
        less capable you are of adapting when life challenges you. If you tie
        everything up in being the point guard or the partner at the firm or
        whatever else, then the loss of that facet of your life will wreck you.
        If you’re a vegan and then develop a health condition that forces you to
        change your diet, you’ll have an identity crisis on your hands. When you
        cling too tightly to one identity, you become brittle. Lose that one
        thing and you lose yourself.</p>
      <p>For most of my young life, being an athlete was a major part of my
        identity. After my baseball career ended, I struggled to find myself.
        When you spend your whole life defining yourself in one way and that
        disappears, who are you now?</p>
      <p>Military veterans and former entrepreneurs report similar feelings.
        If your identity is wrapped up in a belief like “I’m a great soldier,”
        what happens when your period of service ends? For many business owners,
        their identity is something along the lines of “I’m the CEO” or “I’m the
        founder.” If you have spent every waking moment working on your
        business, how will you feel after you sell the company?</p>
      <p>The key to mitigating these losses of identity is to redefine
        yourself such that you get to keep important aspects of your identity
        even if your particular role changes.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>“I’m an athlete” becomes “I’m the type of person who is mentally
            tough and loves a physical challenge.”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>“I’m a great soldier” transforms into “I’m the type of person who
            is disciplined, reliable, and great on a team.”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>“I’m the CEO” translates to “I’m the type of person who builds
            and creates things.”</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>When chosen effectively, an identity can be flexible rather than
        <span id="32_20_The_Downside_of_Cr.xhtml#page_249" class="pagebreak" title="249"></span>brittle. Like water
        flowing around an obstacle, your
        identity works with the changing circumstances rather than against
        them.
      </p>
      <p>The following quote from the <em>Tao Te Ching</em> encapsulates the
        ideas perfectly:</p>
      <p>Men are born soft and supple;</p>
      <p>dead, they are stiff and hard.</p>
      <p>Plants are born tender and pliant;</p>
      <p>dead, they are brittle and dry.</p>
      <p>Thus whoever is stiff and inflexible</p>
      <p>is a disciple of death.</p>
      <p>Whoever is soft and yielding</p>
      <p>is a disciple of life.</p>
      <p>The hard and stiff will be broken.</p>
      <p>The soft and supple will prevail.</p>
      <p>—L<span class="SCAP">AO</span> T<span class="SCAP">ZU</span></p>
      <p>Habits deliver numerous benefits, but the downside is that they can
        lock us into our previous patterns of thinking and acting—even when the
        world is shifting around us. Everything is impermanent. Life is
        constantly changing, so you need to periodically check in to see if your
        old habits and beliefs are still serving you.</p>
      <p>A lack of self-awareness is poison. Reflection and review is the
        antidote.</p>

      <p>T<span class="RunIn">HERE IS AN </span>ancient Greek parable known as
        the Sorites Paradox,<span id="33_Conclusion_The_Secret.xhtml#footnote-034-backlink"><a
            href="76_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_1" class="_idFootnoteLink noteref" role="doc-noteref">*</a></span> which
        talks about the effect one small
        action can have when repeated enough times. One formulation of the
        paradox goes as follows: Can one coin make a person rich? If you give a
        person a pile of ten coins, you wouldn’t claim that he or she is rich.
        But what if you add another? And another? And another? At some point,
        you will have to admit that <span id="33_Conclusion_The_Secret.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText244"></span>no one
        can be rich unless one coin can make him or her so.</p>
      <p>We can say the same about atomic habits. Can one tiny change
        transform your life? It’s unlikely you would say so. But what if you
        made another? And another? And another? At some point, you will have to
        admit that your life was transformed by one small change.</p>
      <p>The holy grail of habit change is not a single 1 percent improvement,
        but a thousand of them. It’s a bunch of atomic habits stacking up, each
        one a fundamental unit of the overall system.</p>
      <p>In the beginning, small improvements can often seem meaningless
        because they get washed away by the weight of the system. Just as one
        <span id="33_Conclusion_The_Secret.xhtml#page_252" class="pagebreak" title="252"></span>coin won’t make you
        rich, one positive change like
        meditating for one minute or reading one page each day is unlikely to
        deliver a noticeable difference.
      </p>
      <p>Gradually, though, as you continue to layer small changes on top of
        one another, the scales of life start to move. Each improvement is like
        adding a grain of sand to the positive side of the scale, slowly tilting
        things in your favor. Eventually, if you stick with it, you hit a
        tipping point. Suddenly, it feels easier to stick with good habits. The
        weight of the system is working for you rather than against you.</p>
      <p>Over the course of this book, we’ve looked at dozens of stories about
        top performers. We’ve heard about Olympic gold medalists, award-winning
        artists, business leaders, lifesaving physicians, and star comedians who
        have all used the science of small habits to master their craft and
        vault to the top of their field. Each of the people, teams, and
        companies we have covered has faced different circumstances, but
        ultimately progressed in the same way: through a commitment to tiny,
        sustainable, unrelenting improvements.</p>
      <p>Success is not a goal to reach or a finish line to cross. It is a
        system to improve, an endless process to refine. In Chapter 1, I said,
        “If you’re having trouble changing your habits, the problem isn’t you.
        The problem is your system. Bad habits repeat themselves again and again
        not because you don’t want to change, but because you have the wrong
        system for change.”</p>
      <p>As this book draws to a close, I hope the opposite is true. With the
        Four Laws of Behavior Change, you have a set of tools and strategies
        that you can use to build better systems and shape better habits.
        Sometimes a habit will be hard to remember and you’ll need to <em>make
          it obvious</em>. Other times you won’t feel like starting and you’ll
        need to <em>make it attractive</em>. In many cases, you may find that a
        habit will be too difficult and you’ll need to <em>make it easy</em>.
        And sometimes, you won’t feel like sticking with it and you’ll need to
        <em>make it satisfying</em>.

      <p>You want to push your good habits toward the left side of the
        spectrum by making them obvious, attractive, easy, and satisfying.
        Meanwhile, you want to cluster your bad habits toward the right side by
        making them invisible, unattractive, hard, and unsatisfying.</p>
      <p>This is a continuous process. There is no finish line. There is no
        permanent solution. Whenever you’re looking to improve, you can rotate
        through the Four Laws of Behavior Change until you find the next
        bottleneck. <em>Make it obvious. Make it attractive. Make it easy. Make
          it satisfying.</em> Round and round. Always looking for the next way to
        get 1 percent better.</p>
      <p>The secret to getting results that last is to never stop making
        improvements. It’s remarkable what you can build if you just don’t stop.
        It’s remarkable the business you can build if you don’t stop working.
        It’s remarkable the body you can build if you don’t stop training. It’s
        remarkable the knowledge you can build if you don’t stop learning. It’s
        remarkable the fortune you can build if you don’t stop saving. It’s
        remarkable the friendships you can build if you don’t stop caring. Small
        habits don’t add up. They compound.</p>

        Laws</h2>
      <p>I<span class="RunIn">N THIS BOOK</span>, I have introduced a
        four-step model for human behavior: cue, craving, response, reward. This
        framework not only teaches us how to create new habits but also reveals
        some interesting insights about human behavior.</p>
      <div class="table">
        <p>Problem phase</p>
        <p><strong>1. Cue</strong></p>
        <p><strong>2. Craving</strong></p>
        <p>Solution phase</p>
        <p><strong>3. Response</strong></p>
        <p><strong>4. Reward</strong></p>
      </div>
      <p>In this section, I have compiled some lessons (and a few bits of
        common sense) that are confirmed by the model. The purpose of these
        examples is to clarify just how useful and wide-ranging this framework
        is when describing human behavior. Once you understand the model, you’ll
        see examples of it everywhere.</p>
      <p><strong>Awareness comes before desire.</strong> A craving is created
        when you assign meaning to a cue. Your brain constructs an emotion or
        feeling to describe your current situation, and that means a craving can
        only occur after you have noticed an opportunity.</p>
      <p><strong>Happiness is simply the absence of desire.</strong> When you
        observe a <span id="36_Little_Lessons_from_t.xhtml#page_260" class="pagebreak" title="260"></span>cue, but do
        not desire to change
        your state, you are content with the current situation. Happiness is not
        about the achievement of pleasure (which is joy or satisfaction), but
        about the lack of desire. It arrives when you have no urge to feel
        differently. Happiness is the state you enter when you no longer want to
        change your state.</p>
      <p>However, happiness is fleeting because a new desire always comes
        along. As Caed Budris says, “<span id="36_Little_Lessons_from_t.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText245"></span>Happiness
        is the space between one desire being fulfilled and a new desire
        forming.” Likewise, suffering is the space between craving a change in
        state and getting it.</p>
      <p><strong>It is the</strong> <span class="BOLD_ITAL">idea</span>
        <strong>of pleasure that we chase.</strong> We seek the image of
        pleasure that we generate in our minds. At the time of action, we do not
        know what it will be like to attain that image (or even if it will
        satisfy us). The feeling of satisfaction only comes afterward. This is
        what the Austrian neurologist Victor Frankl meant when he said that
        <span id="36_Little_Lessons_from_t.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText246"></span>happiness
        cannot be pursued, it must ensue. Desire is pursued. Pleasure ensues
        from action.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Peace occurs when you don’t turn your observations into
          problems.</strong> The first step in any behavior is observation. You
        notice a cue, a bit of information, an event. If you do not desire to
        act on what you observe, then you are at peace.</p>
      <p>Craving is about wanting to fix everything. Observation without
        craving is the realization that you do not need to fix anything. Your
        desires are not running rampant. You do not crave a change in state.
        Your mind does not generate a problem for you to solve. You’re simply
        observing and existing.</p>
      <p><strong>With a big enough</strong> <span class="BOLD_ITAL">why</span>
        <strong>you can overcome any</strong> <span class="BOLD_ITAL">how</span><strong>.</strong> Friedrich Nietzsche,
        the
        German philosopher and poet, famously wrote, “<span
          id="36_Little_Lessons_from_t.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText247"></span>He who
        has a why to live for can bear almost any how.” This phrase harbors an
        important truth about human behavior. If your motivation and desire are
        great enough (that is, <em>why</em> are you are acting), you’ll take
        action <span id="36_Little_Lessons_from_t.xhtml#page_261" class="pagebreak" title="261"></span>even when it is
        quite difficult.
        Great craving can power great action—even when friction is high.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Being curious is better than being smart.</strong> Being
        motivated and curious counts for more than being smart because it leads
        to action. Being smart will never deliver results on its own because it
        doesn’t get you to act. It is desire, not intelligence, that prompts
        behavior. As Naval Ravikant says, “The trick to doing anything is first
        cultivating a desire for it.”</p>
      <p><strong>Emotions drive behavior.</strong> Every decision is an
        emotional decision at some level. Whatever your logical reasons are for
        taking action, you only feel compelled to act on them because of
        emotion. In fact, people with damage to emotional centers of the brain
        can list many reasons for taking action but still will not act because
        they do not have emotions to drive them. This is why craving comes
        <em>before</em> response. The feeling comes first, and then the
        behavior.
      </p>
      <p><strong>We can only be rational and logical</strong> <span class="BOLD_ITAL">after</span> <strong>we have been
          emotional.</strong>
        The primary mode of the brain is to feel; the secondary mode is to
        think. Our first response—the fast, nonconscious portion of the brain—is
        optimized for feeling and anticipating. Our second response—the slow,
        conscious portion of the brain—is the part that does the “thinking.”</p>
      <p>Psychologists refer to this as System 1 (feelings and rapid
        judgments) versus System 2 (rational analysis). <span
          id="36_Little_Lessons_from_t.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText248"></span>The
        feeling comes first (System 1); the rationality only intervenes later
        (System 2). This works great when the two are aligned, but it results in
        illogical and emotional thinking when they are not.</p>
      <p><strong>Your response tends to follow your emotions.</strong> Our
        thoughts and actions are rooted in what we find attractive, not
        necessarily in what is logical. Two people can notice the same set of
        facts and respond very differently because they run those facts through
        their unique emotional filter. This is one reason why <span
          id="36_Little_Lessons_from_t.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText249"></span>appealing
        to emotion is typically <span id="36_Little_Lessons_from_t.xhtml#page_262" class="pagebreak"
          title="262"></span>more powerful than appealing to reason. If a topic
        makes someone feel emotional, they will rarely be interested in the
        data. This is why emotions can be such a threat to wise decision
        making.</p>
      <p>Put another way: most people believe that the reasonable response is
        the one that benefits them: the one that satisfies their desires. To
        approach a situation from a more neutral emotional position allows you
        to base your response on the data rather than the emotion.</p>
      <p><strong>Suffering drives progress.</strong> The source of all
        suffering is the desire for a change in state. This is also the source
        of all progress. The desire to change your state is what powers you to
        take action. It is wanting more that pushes humanity to seek
        improvements, develop new technologies, and reach for a higher level.
        With craving, we are dissatisfied but driven. Without craving, we are
        satisfied but lack ambition.</p>
      <p><strong>Your actions reveal how badly you want something.</strong> If
        you keep saying something is a priority but you never act on it, then
        you don’t really want it. It’s time to have an honest conversation with
        yourself. Your actions reveal your true motivations.</p>
      <p><strong>Reward is on the other side of sacrifice.</strong> Response
        (sacrifice of energy) always precedes reward (the collection of
        resources). The “runner’s high” only comes after the hard run. The
        reward only comes after the energy is spent.</p>
      <p><strong>Self-control is difficult because it is not
          satisfying.</strong> A reward is an outcome that satisfies your craving.
        This makes self-control ineffective because inhibiting our desires does
        not usually resolve them. Resisting temptation does not satisfy your
        craving; it just ignores it. It creates space for the craving to pass.
        Self-control requires you to release a desire rather than satisfy
        it.</p>
      <p><strong>Our expectations determine our satisfaction.</strong> The gap
        between our cravings and our rewards determines how satisfied we feel
        after taking action. If the mismatch between expectations and outcomes
        is positive (surprise and delight), then we are more likely to repeat a
        <span id="36_Little_Lessons_from_t.xhtml#page_263" class="pagebreak" title="263"></span>behavior in the future.
        If the mismatch is negative
        (disappointment and frustration), then we are less likely to do so.
      </p>
      <p>For example, if you expect to get $10 and get $100, you feel great.
        If you expect to get $100 and get $10, you feel disappointed. Your
        expectation changes your satisfaction. An average experience preceded by
        high expectations is a disappointment. An average experience preceded by
        low expectations is a delight. When liking and wanting are approximately
        the same, you feel satisfied.</p>
      <p><span id="36_Little_Lessons_from_t.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText250"></span>Satisfaction
        = Liking – Wanting</p>
      <p>This is the wisdom behind Seneca’s famous quote, “<span
          id="36_Little_Lessons_from_t.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText251"></span>Being
        poor is not having too little, it is wanting more.” If your wants
        outpace your likes, you’ll always be unsatisfied. You’re perpetually
        putting more weight on the problem than the solution.</p>
      <p>Happiness is relative. When I first began sharing my writing publicly
        it took me three months to get one thousand subscribers. When I hit that
        milestone, I told my parents and my girlfriend. We celebrated. I felt
        excited and motivated. A few years later, I realized that one thousand
        people were signing up each day. And yet I didn’t even think to tell
        anyone. It felt normal. I was getting results ninety times faster than
        before but experiencing little pleasure over it. It wasn’t until a few
        days later that I realized how absurd it was that I wasn’t celebrating
        something that would have seemed like a pipe dream just a few years
        before.</p>
      <p><strong>The pain of failure correlates to the height of
          expectation.</strong> When desire is high, it hurts to not <em>like</em>
        the outcome. Failing to attain something you want hurts more than
        failing to attain something you didn’t think much about in the first
        place. This is why people say, “I don’t want to get my hopes up.”</p>
      <p><strong>Feelings come both before and after the behavior.</strong>
        Before acting, there is a feeling that motivates you to act—the craving.
        After acting, <span id="36_Little_Lessons_from_t.xhtml#page_264" class="pagebreak" title="264"></span>there is a
        feeling that teaches you
        to repeat the action in the future—the reward.</p>
      <p>Cue &gt; Craving (Feeling) &gt; Response &gt; Reward (Feeling)</p>
      <p>How we feel influences how we act, and how we act influences how we
        feel.</p>
      <p><strong>Desire initiates. Pleasure sustains.</strong> Wanting and
        liking are the two drivers of behavior. If it’s not desirable, you have
        no reason to do it. Desire and craving are what initiate a behavior. But
        if it’s not enjoyable, you have no reason to repeat it. Pleasure and
        satisfaction are what sustain a behavior. Feeling motivated gets you to
        act. Feeling successful gets you to repeat.</p>
      <p><strong>Hope declines with experience and is replaced by
          acceptance.</strong> The first time an opportunity arises, there is hope
        of what could be. Your expectation (cravings) is based solely on
        <em>promise</em>. The second time around, your expectation is grounded
        in reality. You begin to understand how the process works and your hope
        is gradually traded for a more accurate prediction and acceptance of the
        likely outcome.
      </p>
      <p>This is one reason why we continually grasp for the latest
        get-rich-quick or weight-loss scheme. New plans offer hope because we
        don’t have any experiences to ground our expectations. New strategies
        seem more appealing than old ones because they can have unbounded hope.
        <span id="36_Little_Lessons_from_t.xhtml#EndnotePhraseInText252"></span>As
        Aristotle noted, “Youth is easily deceived because it is quick to hope.”
        Perhaps this can be revised to “Youth is easily deceived because it only
        hopes.” There is no experience to root the expectation in. In the
        beginning, hope is all you have.

    <p>I <span class="RunIn">HAVE RELIED HEAVILY </span>on others during the
      creation of this book. Before anyone else, I must thank my wife, Kristy,
      who has been indispensable throughout this process. She has played every
      role a person can play in the writing of a book: spouse, friend, fan,
      critic, editor, researcher, therapist. It is no exaggeration to say this
      book would not be the same without her. It might not exist at all. Like
      everything in our life, we did it together.</p>
    <p>Second, I am grateful to my family, not only for their support and
      encouragement on this book but also for believing in me no matter what
      project I happen to be working on. I have benefited from many years of
      support from my parents, grandparents, and siblings. In particular, I
      want my mom and dad to know that I love them. It is a special feeling to
      know that your parents are your greatest fans.</p>
    <p>Third, to my assistant, Lyndsey Nuckols. At this point, her job
      defies description as she has been asked to do nearly everything one
      could imagine for a small business. Thankfully, her skills and talents
      are more powerful than my questionable management style. Some sections
      of this book are as much hers as they are mine. I am deeply grateful for
      her help.</p>
    <p><span id="39_Acknowledgments.xhtml#page_270" class="pagebreak" title="270"></span>As for the content and writing
      of the book, I have a
      long list of people to thank. To start, there are a few people from whom
      I have learned so much that it would be a crime to not mention them by
      name. Leo Babauta, Charles Duhigg, Nir Eyal, and BJ Fogg have each
      influenced my thoughts on habits in meaningful ways. Their work and
      ideas can be found sprinkled throughout this text. If you enjoyed this
      book, I’d encourage you to read their writing as well.</p>
    <p>At various stages of writing, I benefited from the guidance of many
      fine editors. Thanks to Peter Guzzardi for walking me through the early
      stages of the writing process and for a kick in the pants when I really
      needed it. I am indebted to Blake Atwood and Robin Dellabough for
      transforming my ugly and insanely long first drafts into a tight,
      readable manuscript. And I am thankful to Anne Barngrover for her
      ability to add a little class and poetic style to my writing.</p>
    <p>I’d like to thank the many people who read early versions of the
      manuscript, including Bruce Ammons, Darcey Ansell, Tim Ballard, Vishal
      Bhardwaj, Charlotte Blank, Jerome Burt, Sim Campbell, Al Carlos, Nicky
      Case, Julie Chang, Jason Collins, Debra Croy, Roger Dooley, Tiago Forte,
      Matt Gartland, Andrew Gierer, Randy Giffen, Jon Giganti, Adam Gilbert,
      Stephan Guyenet, Jeremy Hendon, Jane Horvath, Joakim Jansson, Josh
      Kaufman, Anne Kavanagh, Chris Klaus, Zeke Lopez, Cady Macon, Cyd Madsen,
      Kiera McGrath, Amy Mitchell, Anna Moise, Stacey Morris, Tara-Nicholle
      Nelson, Taylor Pearson, Max Shank, Trey Shelton, Jason Shen, Jacob
      Zangelidis, and Ari Zelmanow. The book benefited greatly from your
      feedback.</p>
    <p>To the team at Avery and Penguin Random House who made this book a
      reality, thank you. I owe a debt of special thanks to my publisher,
      Megan Newman, for her endless patience as I continually pushed back
      deadlines. She gave me the space I needed to create a book I was proud
      of and championed my ideas at every step. To Nina, for her ability to
      transform my writing while still retaining my original message. To <span id="39_Acknowledgments.xhtml#page_271"
        class="pagebreak" title="271"></span>Lindsay, Farin, Casey, and the rest of the PRH team
      for spreading the message of this book to more people than I could ever
      reach on my own. To Pete Garceau, for designing a beautiful cover for
      this book.</p>
    <p>And to my agent, Lisa DiMona, for her guidance and insight at every
      step of the publishing process.</p>
    <p>To the many friends and family members who asked “How’s the book
      going?” and offered a word of encouragement when I inevitably replied
      “Slowly”—thank you. Every author faces a few dark moments when writing a
      book, and one kind word can be enough to get you to show up again the
      next day.</p>
    <p>I am sure there are people I have forgotten, but I keep an updated
      list of anyone who has influenced my thinking in meaningful ways at <a
        href="http://jamesclear.com/thanks">jamesclear.com/thanks</a>.</p>
    <p>And finally, to you. Life is short and you have shared some of your
      precious time with me by reading this book. Thank you.</p>

    <p>I<span class="RunIn">N</span><span class="RunIn"> THIS
        SECTION</span>, I have included a detailed list of notes, references,
      and citations for each chapter in the book. I trust that most readers
      will find this list to be sufficient. However, I also realize that
      scientific literature changes over time and the references for this book
      may need to be updated. Furthermore, I fully expect that I have made a
      mistake somewhere in this book—either in attributing an idea to the
      wrong person or not giving credit to someone where it is due. (If you
      believe this to be the case, please email me at <a href="mailto:james@jamesclear.com">james@jamesclear.com</a> so
      I can fix

      factor that is within your control. And the only self-improvement
      strategy that makes any sense is to focus on what you can control.</p>

      psychological rule says that when an inner situation is not made
      conscious, it happens outside, as fate. That is to say, when the
      individual remains undivided and does not become conscious of his inner
      opposite, the world must perforce act out the conflict and be torn into
      opposing halves.” For more, see C. G. Jung, <em>Aion: Researches into

      control have even been successfully used to help people with insomnia.
      In short, those who had trouble falling asleep were told to only go to
      their room and lie in their bed when they were tired. If they couldn’t
      fall asleep, they were told to get up and change rooms. Strange advice,
      but over time, researchers found that by associating the bed with ‘It’s
      time to go to sleep’ and not with other activities (reading a book, just
      lying there, etc.), participants were eventually able to quickly fall
      asleep due to the repeated process: it became almost automatic to fall
      asleep in their bed because a successful trigger had been created.” For

          importance of dopamine</strong></a><strong>:</strong> “The importance of
      dopamine was discovered by accident. In 1954, James Olds and Peter
      Milner, two neuroscientists at McGill University, decided to implant an
      electrode deep into the center of a rat’s brain. The precise placement
      of the electrode was largely happenstance; at the time, the geography of
      the mind remained a mystery. But Olds and Milner got lucky. They
      inserted the needle right next to the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), a part
      of the brain that generates pleasurable feelings. Whenever you eat a
      piece of chocolate cake, or listen to a favorite pop song, or watch your
      favorite team win the World Series, it is your NAcc that helps you feel
      so happy. But Olds and Milner quickly discovered that too much pleasure
      can be fatal. They placed the electrodes in several rodents’ brains and
      then ran a small current into each wire, making the NAccs continually
      excited. The scientists noticed that the rodents lost interest in
      everything. They stopped eating and drinking. All courtship behavior
      ceased. The rats would just huddle in the corners of their cages,
      transfixed by their bliss. Within days, all of the animals had perished.
      They died of thirst. For more, see Jonah Lehrer, <em>How We Decide</em>

      there was just one actor in the group who disagreed with the group, then
      the subject was far more likely to state their true belief that the
      lines were different lengths. When you have an opinion that dissents
      from the tribe, it is much easier to stand by it if you have an ally.
      When you need the strength to stand up to the social norm, find a
      partner. For more, see Solomon E. Asch, “Opinions and Social Pressure,”

    <p>Nearly 75 percent of subjects made the incorrect choice at least

          efforts</strong></a><strong>:</strong> This story comes from page 29 of
      <em>Art &amp; Fear</em> by David Bayles and Ted Orland. In an email
      conversation with Orland on October 18, 2016, he explained the origins
      of the story. “Yes, the ‘ceramics story’ in ‘Art &amp; Fear’ is indeed
      true, allowing for some literary license in the retelling. Its
      real-world origin was as a gambit employed by photographer Jerry
      Uelsmann to motivate his Beginning Photography students at the <span id="40_Notes.xhtml#page_287"
        class="pagebreak" title="287"></span>University of Florida. As retold in ‘Art &amp; Fear’
      it faithfully captures the scene as Jerry told it to me—except I
      replaced photography with ceramics as the medium being explored.
      Admittedly, it would’ve been easier to retain photography as the art
      medium being discussed, but David Bayles (co-author) &amp; I are both
      photographers ourselves, and at the time we were consciously trying to
      broaden the range of media being referenced in the text. The intriguing
      thing to me is that it hardly matters what art form was invoked—the
      moral of the story appears to hold equally true straight across the
      whole art spectrum (and even outside the arts, for that matter).” Later
      in that same email, Orland said, “You have our permission to reprint any
      or all of the ‘ceramics’ passage in your forthcoming book.” In the end,
      I settled on publishing an adapted version, which combines their telling
      of the ceramics story with facts from the original source of Uelsmann’s
      photography students. David Bayles and Ted Orland, <em>Art &amp; Fear:

      “All traits are heritable” is a bit of an exaggeration, but not by much.
      Concrete behavioral traits that patently depend on content provided by
      the home or culture are, of course, not heritable at all; which language
      you speak, which religion you worship in, which political party you
      belong to. But behavioral traits that reflect the underlying talents and
      temperaments are heritable: how proficient with language you are, how
      religious, how liberal or conservative. General intelligence is
      heritable, and so are the five major ways in which personality can
      vary . . . openness to experience, conscientiousness,
      extroversion-introversion, antagonism-agreeableness, and neuroticism.
      And traits that are surprisingly specific turn out to be heritable, too,
      such as dependence on nicotine or alcohol, number of hours of television
      watched, and likelihood of divorcing. Thomas J. Bouchard, “Genetic
      Influence on Human Psychological Traits,” <em>Current Directions in
