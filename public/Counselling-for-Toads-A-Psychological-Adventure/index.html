    <p><span class="bold">COUNSELLING FOR TOADS</span></p>
    <p>Toad, the famous character in Kenneth Grahame’s <span class="italic">The Wind in the Willows, </span> is in a
      very
      depressed
      state and his good friends Rat, Mole and Badger are ‘worried that he
      might do something silly’….</p>
    <p>‘First they nursed him. Then they encouraged him. Then they told him
      to pull himself together…. Finally, Badger could stand it no longer.
      That admirable animal, though long on exhortation, was short on
      patience. “Now look here Toad, this can go on no longer,” he said
      sternly. “There is only one thing left. You must have counselling!”’</p>
    <p>Robert de Board’s engaging account of Toad’s experience of
      counselling will capture the imagination of the growing readership of
      people who are interested in counselling and the counselling process. In
      this sequel to the story of life on the River Bank, Toad and his friends
      come to life all over again. Heron, the counsellor, uses the language
      and the ideas of transactional analysis as his counselling method.
      Through the dialogues which make up the ten sessions or chapters of the
      book, Toad learns how to analyse his own feelings and develop his
      emotional intelligence. He meets his ‘rebellious child’ and his ‘adult’
      along the way and by the end of the book, as debonair as ever he was, is
      setting out on a completely new adventure. As readers learn about Toad,
      so they can learn about themselves and be encouraged to take the path of
      psychological growth and development.</p>
    <p>Robert de Board, author of a best-selling textbook on counselling,
      says:</p>
    <p>‘Toad’s experiences are based on my own work of counselling people
      over a period of twenty years. Counselling for Toads is really an
      amalgamation of the many counselling sessions I have held and contains a
      distillation of the truths I have learned from practice.’</p>
    <p>Appropriate f or anyone approaching counselling, whether as a
      student, client or counsellor, <span class="italic">Counselling for
        Toads</span> will appeal to both children and adults of all ages.</p>

    <p><span class="bold">Mole finds Toad in a poorly state</span></p>
    <p>The weather was changing on the river bank. There was something
      ominous in the air that had not been there before. Black thunder-clouds
      hung menacingly over the fields. A few birds flitted pointlessly among
      the hedgerows singing a song, the notes of which they seemed scarcely
      able to remember. Even the ducks, who had as usual been quarrelling and
      quacking about supposed snubs and alleged insults, nestled into the
      reeds and chose to ignore all but the most outrageous attacks. Only the
      river moved on, black and sinuous, always changing yet always the same,
      creating a boundary for some animals, a highway for others, and with a
      suppressed energy and power that was only dangerous when ignored.</p>
    <p>In this oppressive weather, Mole decided to go out. If he were to be
      honest, he was getting a bit restless, if not fed up, living with Rat.
      Yet even as he thought this, he felt guilty.</p>
    <p>For had not Ratty befriended Mole, taken him from his dull old house
      and introduced him to all his jolly friends? And what friends they were
      too; and what adventures they had had!</p>
    <p>Boating on the river, meeting Badger, caravanning with Toad and
      finally playing an heroic part in the rescue of Toad Hall from the
      Wildwooders.</p>
    <p>And yet, and yet…. Mole found it hard to describe exactly how he was
      feeling but it was something to do with his very self. In fact, that was
      it. He felt that he was rarely able to <span class="italic">be</span>
      himself because he was always standing in Rat’s shadow. If they went
      boating, Rat would usually tell him that he was not doing it right, like
      not feathering his oars properly.</p>
    <p>When they moored, Rat would check the painter to see that Mole had
      secured it properly and invariably give it another turn around the
      post.</p>
    <p>If they got lost, Rat always knew the way, just as he had done when
      he rescued Mole in a snowstorm in the Wild Wood. Or that time when, on a
      long walk, they chanced upon Mole’s old house and, not unnaturally, Mole
      was overcome with emotion. Not so the ever-capable Rat, who took over,
      got the field mice to buy food and drink and organised a splendid
      evening.</p>
    <p>The trouble was that the Rat <span class="italic">did</span> seem to
      be more capable than he was. He could scull better, he knew more knots
      and bends (he could even do a square lashing) and he really did take
      care of Mole. But in spite of this friendship and kindness, Mole felt
      dissatisfied.</p>
    <p>He wished that Rat wasn’t <span class="italic">quite</span> so
      capable and that he would let Mole try out things in his own way, even
      if that meant getting it wrong. Of course, this had happened, like the
      first time he was in Rat’s boat and grabbed the oars—and inevitably
      tipped the boat over. Rat had rescued him with great good humour and yet
      Mole thought, ‘If I hear Rat tell that story at dinner ever again, I
      shall scream!’</p>
    <p>Mole was thinking these thoughts as he put on his raincoat and
      sou’wester. He said to the Rat, ‘I think I’ll just pop over for a chat
      with Toad. We haven’t seen him for ages and the walk will do me good.’
      The Rat, who was murmuring poetry things to himself and was trying to
      find a rhyme for ‘effervescent’, scarcely looked up but as Mole was
      going out of the door suddenly shouted, ‘Be careful, Moley. Think of
      what happened last time you went out on your own!’ He was of course
      referring to the time when Mole got lost in the Wild Wood and Rat had
      saved him. Mole was furious and called Rat several unflattering words
      under his breath. Out loud he said, ‘Thank you Ratty. I’ll take care,’
      adding <span class="italic">sotto voce, </span> ‘you stupid, squint-eyed
      rodent’, which Rat did not hear and which he was not meant to. But it
      made Mole feel better.</p>
    <p>It was in this frame of mind that Mole walked over to Toad Hall,
      scarcely responding to the polite greetings of the rabbits he met on the
      way. He knew that he had gained their respect since arriving at the
      river bank and no one would demand any toll from him, as they once had
      done. Let them dare! And yet, did he only imagine that he heard one say
      in a rather horrid way, ‘That’s strange. You don’t often see Mole on his
      own’?</p>
    <p>In this rather miserable frame of mind, he found himself walking up
      the drive to Toad Hall. Toad Hall was impressive, there were no two ways
      about it. It had recently been described in a glossy county magazine as
      ‘A gentleman’s residence, benefiting from a secluded position on the
      bank of the river, enjoying expansive views across the Wild Wood and
      beyond. All this is surrounded by extensive and mature gardens with
      outlying paddocks and other buildings.’ No wonder Toad was so proud of
      it.</p>
    <p>But as Mole walked up the long drive, he was shocked to see how
      everything seemed run down. The hedges were untrimmed and the rose-beds
      were full of weeds. The lawns were covered in leaves and the whole place
      looked unkempt and uncared for. Even the Hall itself looked grim and
      forbidding. The white paint, which used to sparkle in the sun, was dull
      and flaking. The creepers and climbing roses, which brought such colour
      and vibrancy to the walls, were dying and hanging down like black ropes.
      The windows, always clear and shiny, seemed only to reflect the dark and
      brooding weather and added to the atmosphere of grim foreboding. Mole
      shivered.</p>
    <p>Pressing the buzzer he heard the bell ringing deep within the house.
      There was no answer and so he pressed a second time. Again the bell rang
      loudly, but to no avail. ‘Oh well’ thought Mole, ‘I might have guessed
      that Toad would be out enjoying himself. He’s probably at his club
      playing billiards.’ This was a game at which Toad was particularly
      adept. Reluctant to leave, Mole walked around the house past the walled
      kitchen garden and came to the back door. He looked through the kitchen
      window to see what might be there. The room was empty, although there
      was some evidence that the stove was alight.</p>
    <p>He knew this room well, for it was furnished with comfortable old
      chairs in which he and Toad had sat and enjoyed many a hot mug of coffee
      on a winter’s day. And then he saw, on a chair, a large heap of old
      clothes. Suddenly, the clothes started to move! Mole, being a timid
      creature, was about to run off into the garden when the clothes fell
      away to reveal… Toad! Mole tugged at the back door and was surprised to
      find that it opened.</p>
    <p>Inside was the saddest Toad he had ever seen. Toad’s eyes, always
      large, were now hooded and dull. His cricket sweater, which he
      invariably wore around the house, was covered in food stains. And his
      plus-fours, usually immaculate and worn at just the right length, had
      the appearance of a couple of potato sacks hanging from his waist.</p>
    <p>‘Hello’, said Toad. ‘Sorry about the mess, but I’m not feeling too
      bright at the moment’</p>
    <p>And with that, he burst into tears.</p>
    <p><span class="bold">2 </span></p>
    <p><span class="bold">With friends like these</span>…</p>
    <p>As Mole walked back from Toad Hall later that day, his mind was in
      turmoil. How could Toad, that exciting and excitable animal, have got
      himself into such a sorry state?</p>
    <p>Mole recalled the many hours he had spent with Toad over the years.
      No matter what he was doing, Toad was always smartly dressed to the
      point of parody. Mole especially remembered Toad’s obsession with large
      motorcars and how he always dressed the part: large check overcoat and
      cape, an over-all linen dust-coat, a matching cap worn back-to-front,
      and goggles. And all of this complemented with a huge pair of yellow
      leather gauntlets.</p>
    <p>At the time, Badger had pooh-poohed Toad’s appearance, saying that he
      looked a guy and that no respectable animal would be seen dead with him
      But Badger was wrong.</p>
    <p>Mole thought he looked extremely dashing and compared his own rather
      sombre black smoking-jacket, which he habitually wore, to Toad’s gay
      apparel.</p>
    <p>Mole realised that Toad’s ill-kempt appearance represented a serious
      internal change in his spirits. His previous smart and sometimes
      dramatic wardrobe represented and demonstrated the <span class="italic">élan</span> and <span class="italic">joie
        de
        vivre</span>
      of that singular animal. The bounce and swagger were perfectly displayed
      by loud tweed jackets, ample plus-fours and the whole set off with a
      pink Leander Club bow-tie. So what did it signify about Toad’s emotional
      state that he was unwashed and ungroomed and wearing a sweater stiff
      with food droppings? And if Mole dared admit it, Toad, who always used a
      good cologne, was a bit smelly.</p>
    <p>Later that night after their supper, Rat and Mole were sitting in
      front of a glowing fire, toast-ing their toes and sipping mugs of hot
      toddy. Mole had, of course, told Rat all about Toad and how he had found
      him. Since then the two friends had talked of nothing else. There was
      much ‘tut-tutting’ and ‘What can we do?’ and ‘What can have caused it?’
      Gradually their conversation petered out as each animal sat staring into
      the fire, thinking his own thoughts.</p>
    <p>Eventually Rat picked up the local weekly paper and thumbed through
      it in a desultory sort of way. Mole was half asleep when, suddenly Rat
      sat bolt upright.</p>
    <p>‘Mole, listen to this!’ he said in a commanding manner.</p>
    <p>‘Oh Ratty, you’re not going through the small ads again, are you?’
      said Mole sleepily.</p>
    <p>Rat loved to see what bargains there were to be had, although he
      rarely found one.</p>
    <p>‘Be quiet,’ said Rat in an unusually stern tone. ‘Listen.’ Then he
      proceeded to read out the following advertisement from the <span class="italic">Bankside Bugle</span>.</p>
    <p>“‘A qualified counsellor is now able to receive new clients. Animals
      who have personal problems which are causing them unhappiness or
      distress may care to make an appointment.</p>
    <p>Telephone Heronry 576.”’</p>
    <p>‘Well,’ said the Mole, who had not been listening very attentively,
      ‘so what?’</p>
    <p>‘You perverse and foolish animal,’ said the Rat, not for the first
      time. ‘Don’t you see?</p>
    <p>This could help poor Toady!’</p>
    <p>Mole was by now fully awake. ‘Surely you are not saying that Toad is
      in distress, are you? It’s probably just a stomach upset. You know how
      Toad likes his food. And drink’</p>
    <p>It must be admitted that Toad could sometimes ‘overdo things’, as he
      called it, and had been known to drink more than was good for him. Rat
      and Mole rarely had more than a dry sherry or a glass of beer and took a
      puritanical view of Toad’s occasional bender.</p>
    <p>‘No,’ said Rat. ‘Although I don’t claim to understand these things,
      being myself a simple and uncomplicated creature.’ (Here Mole coughed
      and spluttered into his mug and said it had gone down the wrong
      way.)</p>
    <p>‘But’, the Rat continued, ‘I am very worried about Toad, and I
      propose that you and I visit him tomorrow. I am worried that he might do
      something silly.’ Although the Rat did not explain exactly what he meant
      by these words, both animals exchanged anxious looks.</p>
    <p>‘What’s more, I think we should show Toad this advertisement about
      counselling and make him go.’</p>
    <p>‘Do you think he would?’ asked Mole. ‘After all, he can be a very
      self-willed and stubborn animal with a mind of his own,’</p>
    <p>‘You’re quite right,’ agreed the Rat. ‘But if he is in the state of
      mind that you say he is, he will be putty in our hands!’ With that, both
      animals retired to their beds, full of apprehension about the morrow and
      wondering how Toad would respond to their plan of help. For help him
      they would, whether he liked it or not.</p>
    <p>And so it was that on the next morning, after breakfast, Mole found
      himself once again hurrying along the path to Toad Hall, this time
      accompanied by the Rat. As they walked, they discussed yet again Toad’s
      unhappy situation and what might have caused it and how they would help
      him. Rat carried the newspaper which contained the announcement about
      counselling, although Mole had already memorised the telephone number.
      Suddenly, a deep voice somewhere to their left boomed out, ‘Ratty, my
      dear little man. And Moley.</p>
    <p>What are you two doing here?’</p>
    <p>Mole almost jumped out of his skin, but Rat said, ‘It’s only Badger’
      and as they peered into the wood on their left, the striped head and
      then the rest of Badger appeared.</p>
    <p>‘Well Badger,’ said the Rat, ‘what a surprise! I thought you would be
      at home slee—’ He stopped in mid-sentence. ‘I mean, working,’</p>
    <p>‘So I was,’ said Badger, ‘but I have some work to do here. In fact,
      it concerns a planning application and as I am a member of the District
      Council,’ (Badger spoke these words in capital letters) ‘I thought I
      would walk over and examine the matter personally’ He then said in his
      kindly way, ‘But what are you doing here? You are both looking very
      serious.’</p>
    <p>There was a clearing in the woods and the three animals sat down and
      Mole, helped by Rat, told Badger the sorry tale of Toad and the state in
      which Mole had found him and how, even at this minute, they were on
      their way to help that unhappy animal. Badger looked grim.</p>
    <p>‘I am not in the least surprised,’ he said. ‘It does not behove one
      to criticise one’s friends, but (Mole had been waiting for this ‘but’) I
      have seen this coming for a long time. Toad, although he has many
      excellent qualities which I need not elaborate here, is essentially a
      weak and unstable animal. Bereft of his friends, who in the past have
      given him such good advice and told him precisely what he should do, he
      has let himself go and given way to silly and morbid thoughts. I shall
      therefore accompany you on your errand of mercy. He must be told, in no
      uncertain manner, to pull himself together!’</p>
    <p>Mole and Rat were heartened by Badger’s positive manner and
      determination and together the three comrades, arm-in-arm with Badger in
      the middle, walked purposefully towards Toad Hall. Fortunate Toad! Help
      was on the way.</p>
    <p><span class="bold">3 </span></p>
    <p><span class="bold">Toad’s first meeting with his
        counsellor</span></p>
    <p>It would take too long to narrate all that happened over the next few
      days. First Toad was nursed by his friends. Then they encouraged him.
      Then they told him, quite sternly, to pull himself together. Finally,
      they spelled out the drab and dismal future facing him unless he ‘got a
      grip of himself’, as Badger eloquently put it.</p>
    <p>But none of this had any effect on Toad. He responded as best he
      could, but there were no signs of the old Toad, full of life and eager
      to outwit their well-meant exhortations.</p>
    <p>Instead he remained sad and depressed, and the more his friends
      advised him in detail what he should do, the more sad and depressed he
      became.</p>
    <p>Finally, Badger could stand it no longer. That admirable animal,
      though long on exhortation, was short on patience.</p>
    <p>‘Now, look here Toad, this can go on no longer. We are all trying to
      help you, but it seems you won’t (or can’t, thought Mole perceptively)
      help yourself. There is only one thing left. You must have
      counselling!’</p>
    <p>There was a shocked silence. Even Toad sat up a little straighter.
      None of the animals knew fully what counselling meant, but they knew it
      was a mysterious activity undertaken by people who had experienced some
      severe or shocking event. The Rat, who was a tradi-tionalist at heart,
      said, ‘Do you really think Toad is that bad? I mean, don’t you think
      it’s a bit trendy, all this counselling? It seems from the newspapers
      that everyone these days is given counselling. In my day, people in
      trouble were given a couple of aspirin. It probably did them more good.’
      Ratty remembered that the original suggestion about counselling had come
      from him and he was beginning to get cold feet.</p>
    <p>‘But we’ve got the address of a local counsellor,’ said the Mole. ‘I
      thought we had agreed that Toad ought to see him. I agree with
      Badger.’</p>
    <p>‘Well said, Mole,’ answered Badger. ‘You mustn’t be worried, Ratty.
      Toad must be in a very poor state of health if even the advice I can
      offer appears to fall on deaf ears. I know that you can be obstinate,
      Toad, but it does seem that you need some kind of help which,
      surprisingly, your friends cannot give you. Desperate circumstances
      require desperate rem-edies. We must try counselling.’</p>
    <p>And so it happened that, after much telephoning and arranging and
      pushing and plead-ing, Toad arrived at a large house called The Heronry.
      It was a foursquare, three-storeyed building of red brick mellowed to a
      terracotta colour with occasional bands of yellow. It had an air of
      permanence and sensible values and looked the sort of house where a
      family might remain for a long time. After ringing the bell, Toad was
      shown to a book-lined room with some chairs and a large desk on which
      sat odds and ends, including a china head with words written all over
      the skull. It bore the legend ‘Phrenology by L.N.Fowler’.</p>
    <p>The Heron entered, looking tall and wise, and sat on the chair
      opposite Toad. He wished Toad good morning and then sat quietly looking
      at him. Toad, who had become used to people talking at him, waited for
      the lecture to begin. But nothing happened. In this silence, Toad could
      feel the blood pulsing in his head and it seemed as if this was pumping
      up the tension in the room. He began to feel very uncomfortable. The
      Heron continued to look at him. Finally Toad could stand it no
      longer.</p>
    <p>‘Aren’t you going to tell me what to do?’ he asked plaintively.</p>
    <p>‘About what?’ answered Heron.</p>
    <p>‘Well, tell me what I have to do to get better.’</p>
    <p>‘Are you feeling unwell?’</p>
    <p>‘Yes, I am. But surely they have told you all about me?’</p>
    <p>‘Who are “they”?’ asked Heron.</p>
    <p>‘Oh, you know. Badger and Rat and all that lot.’ And with those
      words, Toad started to cry and let loose a flood of unhappiness that,
      all unknowingly, he had kept pent up for a long time. The Heron remained
      silent but pushed a box of paper tissues nearer to him.</p>
    <p>Eventually Toad’s sobs subsided and he drew breath, and he felt a
      little better. Then the Heron spoke.</p>
    <p>‘Would you like to tell me why you are here?’</p>
    <p>‘I am here’, said Toad, ‘because they made me come.They said that I
      needed counselling and they got your name from the newspaper. And I am
      ready to listen to you and do whatever you think best. I know that they
      have my best interests at heart.’</p>
    <p>The Counsellor shifted in his chair. ‘So who is my client, you or
      them?’</p>
    <p>Toad did not quite understand.</p>
    <p>‘Look,’ said the Counsellor, ‘your friends want me to counsel you so
      that their worry about you will be relieved. You seem to want to be
      helped in order to please them. So I think that my client is really your
      friends.’ Toad was confused by all this and clearly showed it.</p>
    <p>‘Perhaps we can clarify the situation,’ said the Counsellor. ‘Who is
      going to pay for these meetings?’</p>
    <p>I might have guessed, thought Toad. He’s just like the rest of them,
      only anxious about getting paid.</p>
    <p>‘You don’t need to worry about that,’ said Toad, feeling a little
      like his old self. ‘Badger said he would take care of the money side of
      things. You will get paid, never fear.’</p>
    <p>‘Thank you,’ said the Counsellor, ‘but I am afraid that this won’t do
      at all. I suggest that we conclude this meeting and put it down to
      experience.’</p>
    <p>For the first time in many days, Toad began to feel angry. ‘Look
      here,’ he said in a stronger voice, ‘you can’t do that. You call
      yourself a counsellor and I have come here for counselling. I have sat
      here waiting for you to tell me something and now all you can say is
      that my money isn’t good enough. What more do I have to do to get things
      started?’</p>
    <p>‘That is a very good question and I will answer it,’ the Counsellor
      responded.</p>
    <p>‘Counselling is always a voluntary process, both for the counsellor
      and for the client. That means we can only work together if you want to
      do this for your <span class="italic">own</span> sake and not just to
      please your friends. If we agree to work together we need to make a
      contract, and then, at the completion of our work, I would send my
      invoice to you. You see, it’s not a question of money. But this can only
      be your responsibility and no one else’s.’</p>
    <p>Toad’s mind was racing. Without understanding the full import of the
      words, he realised that somehow he was being asked to take
      responsibility for his own counselling. And yet <span class="italic">he</span> was not the counsellor!</p>
    <p>At the same time, the Counsellor had used the word ‘work’ and this
      implied Toad’s active involvement in whatever might happen. All this was
      a long way from his initial attitude of waiting for somebody to tell him
      what to do. These thoughts were disturbing</p>
    <p>but at the same time, exciting. Maybe there was a way out of his
      misery which he could discover for himself. After what seemed an age,
      Toad spoke.</p>
    <p>‘I seem to have made rather an ass of myself and not for the first
      time. But I think I am beginning to see what you are getting at and I
      would like to work with you. Can we start again?’</p>
    <p>‘I rather think that we have started already,’ replied the
      Counsellor. He then went on to spell out in detail what it would mean if
      they agreed to work together on a counselling programme.</p>
    <p>‘We would meet together for an hour once a week, for as long as
      required. I suggest every Tuesday at ten in the morning, starting next
      week. At the final session we will review what we have done and what you
      have learnt and you can consider any future plans you may wish to
      make.’</p>
    <p>‘And how much do you charge?’ asked the practical Toad.</p>
    <p>‘Forty pounds per session,’ replied Heron. ‘I will invoice you for
      that amount at the completion of each session.’ Then after a
      considerable pause he added, ‘Well, have you decided what you would like
      to do?’</p>
    <p>Toad did not often make considered decisions. Either he made them on
      the spur of the moment and lived to regret it, like driving off in a
      motorcar which just happened to take his fancy, or else he did what he
      was told, usually by Badger, and felt miserable as a result. He would
      have liked to have asked the sensible Rat, ‘Ratty, what do you think I
      should do?’ and have the responsibility taken from his shoulders. But
      the Heron was looking at him in a particular way as if he was quite
      certain that he, Toad, would make a sensible decision.</p>
    <p>He finally said, ‘I would like to work with you and try to discover
      why I am feeling so miserable and what I can do to improve things. I
      have got my diary here. Shall we agree on those dates?’</p>
    <p>As the Counsellor was seeing Toad to the door, Toad turned to him and
      said, ‘Do you think that there is some hope for me of getting
      better?’</p>
    <p>The Heron stopped and looked him straight in the eye. ‘Toad, if I did
      not think that we are all capable of change and improvement, I would not
      be doing this work. It is not inevitable that things get better. But
      what I can promise is that you will have my full and undivided
      attention. And I shall expect the same commitment from you. If we both
      work together like that then we can expect a positive outcome. However,
      in the last analysis, it all depends on you.’</p>
    <p>Toad walked down the path, trying to understand what those words
      meant.</p>
    <p><span class="bold">4 </span></p>
    <p><span class="bold">Why Toad feels so depressed</span></p>
    <p>Toad found that the ensuing week went by very slowly. He felt
      listless and kept waking early and having sad and morbid thoughts. He
      usually felt better as the day wore on but in the evenings he found that
      he began to feel quite anxious. He made himself go for a walk every day
      and although there was some wintry sunshine, it seemed to him that he
      saw everything in monochrome, like an old sepia photograph.</p>
    <p>Initially his friends visited him and tried to cheer him up. He and
      the Rat played many games of cribbage (‘Fifteen two, fifteen four and a
      pair’s six’) and the Mole tried to amuse him with all the latest
      river-bank news (‘You’ll never believe what Otter got up to last
      week!’). Badger would sit watching the proceedings and then, when there
      was a silence, he would begin a long and not entirely uninteresting
      story concerning his adventures as a young animal with Toad’s father
      (‘And there we were miles from home and not a penny in our pockets, when
      I thought up this rather clever idea’). After all this, Toad would
      retire to bed exhausted, only to wake at three in the morning and toss
      and turn until dawn.</p>
    <p>When Tuesday finally arrived, Toad experienced a variety of emotions
      as he walked slowly towards the Heronry. He felt some relief that, at
      last, the day was here when he would see the Counsellor again, although
      he had very mixed feelings towards him. He felt anxious about what might
      be said and what might be done. Already, he had had to fight quite hard
      to be allowed to make the journey on his own. But if he had learnt
      anything from the first encounter, it was that the work he had to do
      could only be done by himself. He was beginning to realise that he had
      better start to grow up.</p>
    <p>For the second time he found himself sitting in the study, with the
      Counsellor opposite him. Again there was silence and Toad experienced
      the same mounting pressure and increasing anxiety. Eventually the
      Counsellor spoke.</p>
    <p>‘Well Toad, how are you feeling today?’</p>
    <p>‘Quite well, thank you,’ replied Toad, in the words that he had been
      taught to say as a very little toad and which he now used automatically
      as the unthinking response to this question. It actually meant nothing.
      But the Counsellor was not interested in verbal trivia.</p>
    <p>‘Let me ask you again. How are you really feeling?’</p>
    <p>Toad felt very uncomfortable. ‘How do you mean exactly,
      “feeling”?’</p>
    <p>Toad was not being deliberately obtuse. Like many people, he had
      never consciously considered his own emotions in such a way that he
      could describe them to himself, let alone to anyone else. In fact, he
      had developed many behavioural strategies, albeit unconsciously to avoid
      the possibility of gaining self-knowledge. He had become a great
      ‘greeter’ and his well-known opening gambit on meeting other animals was
      a hearty ‘Hello, you fellows,’ followed by something like, ‘You’ll never
      guess what I’ve been doing!’ or else, ‘Come and see this.’ Consequently,
      no one ever asked him how he was, let alone how he felt.</p>
    <p>So it was a new and unsettling experience to be asked, ‘How are you
      feeling?’, especially by someone who seemed to be genuinely interested
      in his answer. But because Toad had never indulged in self-analysis, he
      genuinely did not know how to describe his internal state.</p>
    <p>‘Let me ask the question in a different way,’ said the Counsellor.
      ‘Suppose we had a sort of thermometer that could measure how you are
      feeling. It has a ten-point scale. The lowest point on the scale is one,
      which means that you are feeling awful and probably suicidal.</p>
    <p>The mid-point is five and means that you are not feeling too bad. Ten
      is the highest point and means that you are feeling euphoric.’ There was
      a flip-chart next to the Counsellor on which he drew his ‘Feelings
      Thermometer’. Then he handed Toad the crayon and said,</p>
    <p>‘Where would you say you are now, Toad?’ Without hesitation, Toad put
      a mark on the scale, midway between one and two.</p>
    <p>‘Have you ever had suicidal thoughts?’ asked the Counsellor in a
      straightforward sort of way. This was a shocking question to ask and it
      frightened Toad to hear it. And yet at the same time it came as
      something of a relief.</p>
    <p>‘Yes, I have,’ he replied quietly. ‘About three months ago, things
      seemed so black that I could see no way out and I thought that I might
      do something silly. But that was before Mole found me. Since then, I
      have still felt depressed, but I haven’t had those awful thoughts. And’,
      he continued with a little more spirit, ‘I certainly would not do
      anything like that now.’</p>
    <p>‘So how do you feel now?’ Again, that same question.</p>
    <p>‘I feel’, said Toad, ‘as if I don’t have much value. I keep thinking
      that I have made a mess of my life. Not like Rat or Mole or especially
      Badger, who are well respected. I’m a bit of a joke really. Oh yes,
      kind-hearted they say and good for a laugh. And generous to a fault.
      “Good old Toady” they say. But what have I done with my life? What have
      I ever achieved?’ And here Toad broke into sobs that racked his
      frame.</p>
    <p>The Counsellor pushed the paper tissues towards him. After a while he
      asked, ‘Have you always felt like this?’</p>
    <p>‘Yes, I suppose I have, on and off, for a long time. Mind, I do have
      times when things seems better and I can get really involved in
      something. But then my spirits start to fall and I seem to lose
      interest. It’s then that I get into what I can only describe as my
      familiar sad feelings. And that is how I’m feeling now.’</p>
    <p>‘So what do you think made you feel unhappy this time?’ the
      Counsellor asked.</p>
    <p>‘It’s quite a long story,’ said Toad.</p>
    <p>‘I’m listening,’ said the Counsellor.</p>
    <p>So Toad began.</p>
    <p>‘I am sure that you know all about my escape from prison and about
      washer-women and barges and horses and motorcars. These are not events
      in my life of which I am particularly proud. Nor do I wish to deny them.
      But they have been talked about a lot and published, so I mean to say no
      more about them. Unless you ask me.’ Toad stopped and looked enquiringly
      at the Heron, who gave no response, so he continued.</p>
    <p>‘Of course, those events had an enormous effect on me, but I think I
      would have got over them, as in many ways I have done. What really hurt
      was the horrid way I was treated on my return.’</p>
    <p>‘Do you remember anything in particular?’ asked Heron.</p>
    <p>‘Yes, I do. I can’t stop going over those events in my mind, time and
      time again, until I can almost enumerate each incident’</p>
    <p>‘What’s the first of these?’ asked Heron.</p>
    <p>‘Well,’ Toad continued, ‘to begin with, after my rather clever final
      escape when I was being chased by a crowd of hooligans and busybodies,
      by a piece of sheer bad luck I fell into the river and nearly drowned.
      Fortunately, Ratty pulled me out of the water and I shall never cease to
      be grateful to him.’</p>
    <p>‘I don’t quite understand,’ said Heron. ‘Why should that make you
      feel unhappy?’</p>
    <p>‘Because of his attitude,’ replied Toad. ‘Naturally, I was dying to
      tell him all about my adventures and I began to recount them even before
      my clothes were dry. But instead of being interested, Rat accused me of
      “swaggering” and insisted that I go and change and try and look like a
      gentleman, “if I could”. Just imagine! I hadn’t seen him for months and
      that’s how he spoke to me.’</p>
    <p>‘So how did that you make you feel?’ asked Heron.</p>
    <p>‘Initially I felt angry. After all, I’d had enough of being ordered
      about in prison. But I was still feeling grateful to Rat for rescuing me
      so I did as he said. We had lunch (I was starving) and I told Rat all
      about my adventures. You know, they are really interesting and much more
      exciting than Rat’s rather dull life.’</p>
    <p>‘So how did he respond?’ asked Heron.</p>
    <p>‘You won’t believe it but what he actually said was, “Don’t you see
      what an awful ass you’ve been making of yourself?” That really hurt me.
      I felt as if I had been reprimanded.’</p>
    <p>And Toad’s eyes filled with tears at this unhappy memory.</p>
    <p>‘What did you do then?’ asked the Heron.</p>
    <p>‘I did what I always do, I suppose. I feel uncomfortable when people
      are displeased with me, so I try to placate them and deflect their
      anger. I would promise to do almost anything to make them like me again.
      So I admitted that I had been an awful ass and promised I would improve
      my behaviour.’</p>
    <p>‘Did it work?’ asked the Heron.</p>
    <p>‘How do you mean “work”?’ asked Toad.</p>
    <p>‘Did it stop Rat being displeased with you?’</p>
    <p>‘I’m not sure,’ answered Toad. ‘Because he then told me the awful
      news that Toad Hall had been captured by the Wildwooders. Now this made
      me really angry. I don’t often get angry, but I was then. Without
      thinking, I rushed out to recapture my beloved home. But the Wildwooders
      were in control and I almost got a bullet in my brain. And then they
      sank my boat so that by the time I returned to Rat’s place, I was wet
      and exhausted and feeling in very low spirits. And I had only been home
      half a day! It wasn’t fair. It really wasn’t fair.’</p>
    <p>And Toad started to sob again at these unhappy memories.</p>
    <p>Heron sat quietly listening to all of this and watched Toad closely
      but said nothing.</p>
    <p>Toad’s sobs gradually turned into sniffs and he looked the picture of
      misery, with some strands of snot hanging from his nose. Again, Heron
      passed him the box of tissues and, like a little child, Toad obediently
      took some and blew his nose and wiped his eyes. After a while, Heron
      said, ‘So how did the Rat greet you this time?’</p>
    <p>Toad struggled to keep his voice under control. ‘How did Rat greet
      me? You won’t believe it but he was angry with me again! He called me a
      “trying animal” and said that he did not know how I managed to keep any
      friends at all. I have to admit that I can understand him feeling a bit
      annoyed. After all, it was his boat that was sunk, but that wasn’t my
      fault.</p>
    <p>And anyhow, he knew I would pay for a new one. As I have done,’ he
      added in a rather whining tone.</p>
    <p>‘So how did you respond to that?’ asked Heron.</p>
    <p>‘In the same sort of way, I suppose, trying to placate him. I
      remember grovelling and saying that I had been headstrong and wilful and
      that I promised to be humble and submissive in the future. When I think
      of that now, I cringe with embarrassment and wonder how I could ever
      have said it. But I would say anything to stop people being angry with
      me and telling me off. Especially Ratty, who I thought was my
      friend.’</p>
    <p>‘So did you start to feel better after this?’ enquired the Heron.</p>
    <p>‘Well, I did for a minute,’ answered Toad. ‘I remember Mole came in
      then and he was about the only person who showed any interest in my
      adventures. But just as I started to tell him some of the really
      interesting bits, in came the one person who can really frighten
      me.’</p>
    <p>‘Who is that?’ asked the Heron.</p>
    <p>‘Badger,’ replied Toad.</p>
    <p>‘Why?’</p>
    <p>Toad answered immediately. ‘Well, for a start, he’s big and strong
      and can seem quite threatening. And when he gives me that stern look, he
      reminds me of my father, who was always criticising me. Anyhow, Badger
      told me off, good and proper, just as I knew he would. I can still
      remember his exact words: “Toad, you bad, troublesome little animal,
      aren’t you ashamed of yourself? What would your father have said about
      these goings on!”</p>
    <p>I was so upset by his disapproval that I burst into tears and
      couldn’t say a thing.’</p>
    <p>Here Toad paused, overcome by these unhappy memories, and strove to
      hold back his imminent tears. After a while, he was able to continue.
      ‘Badger then said that he would let bygones be bygones and we started to
      make plans to recapture Toad Hall that night. Badger was obviously the
      leader although it was my house we were going to rescue. I didn’t mind
      that, because with all his faults, Badger does seem to be a natural
      leader. But he seemed to go out of his way to humiliate me.’</p>
    <p>‘How did he do that?’ asked the Heron.</p>
    <p>‘He told us that there was a secret passage leading up to the Hall. I
      knew nothing about this, but Badger said that my father had told him of
      it. But the point was that he referred to Father as “a worthy animal, a
      lot worthier than some others I could mention”, and he looked straight
      at me when he said this. It made me feel extremely uncomfortable,’ Again
      Toad stopped and swallowed and sniffed and showed every sign of someone
      working bravely to withstand emotions which were too great to bear.
      Eventually he was able to continue.</p>
    <p>‘And as if that wasn’t enough, he went on to say that Father had told
      him not to tell me because—and I can remember his exact words—“He’s a
      good boy, but very light and volatile in character!” All the others
      looked at me and I put on a brave face and talked a lot of nonsense to
      cover my embarrassment, but inside I felt humiliated.’ Toad paused and
      reflected on those unhappy feelings.</p>
    <p>After a while, the Heron asked, ‘Anything else?’</p>
    <p>‘Yes,’ answered Toad. ‘But I don’t want to go on. It makes me too
      upset. Anyhow, you can see why I started to feel miserable. Everyone was
      being so horrid to me. And it wasn’t my fault.’</p>
    <p>There was a long silence, during which neither of them spoke. Then
      the Heron said,</p>
    <p>‘This seems a good place to stop and see if there is anything to be
      learnt from all this.’</p>
    <p>‘Do you mind if I walk around a bit?’ asked Toad. ‘My back’s getting
      a bit achey.’</p>
    <p>The Heron looked stern. ‘I can’t give you permission to make your own
      decisions, Toad.</p>
    <p>What do you want to do?’</p>
    <p>‘I want to walk around a bit,’ said Toad with some spirit, and under
      his breath he added,</p>
    <p>‘And I bloody well will, too!’</p>
    <p>‘Now,’ said Heron, ‘as a result of listening to your story, I have
      one question to ask.’</p>
    <p>‘What’s that?’ asked Toad, resuming his seat.</p>
    <p>‘What state would you say you were in during these incidents?’</p>
    <p>‘I don’t understand you,’ said Toad. ‘What do you mean by
      “state”?’</p>
    <p>‘I mean’, replied the Heron, ‘what words could you use to describe
      how you were feeling and acting during these events which you have just
      related?’</p>
    <p>‘Well, I’ve told you. I was feeling very unhappy and miserable and
      guilty and criticised.’</p>
    <p>‘So let me ask you again,’ replied the Heron. ‘What state were you
      in?’</p>
    <p>Toad sat still and thought deeply. He was not given to concentrated
      thought but now he reviewed in his mind these unhappy events to see what
      general lesson he could learn from each particular incident.</p>
    <p>‘I suppose’, he said slowly, ‘that you could say that I was feeling
      like I used to feel when I was little. Was I feeling like a child? Is
      that what you mean?’</p>
    <p>‘It’s more what <span class="italic">you</span> mean, Toad. Does it
      sound right to you?’</p>
    <p>‘Yes, it does. Yes, of course it does.’ Toad sounded increasingly
      positive. ‘That’s just how I was feeling. It’s how I felt when I was a
      child and I had been severely reprimanded by my father.’</p>
    <p>‘So let’s call that the Child Ego State,’ said the Heron.</p>
    <p>Toad looked puzzled.</p>
    <p>‘It’s really quite simple,’ said the Heron. ‘You will remember from
      your schooldays that “ego” is the Latin for “I”. And if we ask “What
      sort of a state is he in?” we are asking</p>
    <p>“What mode of existence is he in?” So when I say that someone is in
      the Child Ego State, I mean that they are behaving and feeling like a
      child. It doesn’t mean “childish”, rather “childlike”.’</p>
    <p>‘I think I understand,’ said Toad. ‘But is it a bad thing to be in
      this Child State?’</p>
    <p>‘It’s neither good nor bad,’ answered the Heron. ‘It just describes
      how someone actually is. Perhaps a better question to ask is “How
      effective is it to be in the Child State?”’</p>
    <p>‘Well,’ said Toad, ‘I don’t think your question is very helpful
      because you obviously can’t help getting in a state. So whether it’s
      effective or not is beside the point. It obviously depends on the kind
      of person you are. And that’s something you have no control over.’</p>
    <p>‘Is that so?’ asked the Heron. ‘Are you in the Child State now?’</p>
    <p>‘No, of course I’m not. I’m talking to you.’</p>
    <p>‘So why is that?’</p>
    <p>‘Oh, I don’t know why,’ said Toad peevishly. ‘I wish you would stop
      picking on me.</p>
    <p>It’s not fair. My brain hurts. You’re asking me too many questions.
      I’m not a psychologist, you know.’</p>
    <p>‘In that case,’ said the Heron, ‘we had better stop.’ And so they
      did.</p>
    <p><span class="bold">5 </span></p>
    <p><span class="bold">The next meeting</span></p>
    <p>Toad met the Counsellor the following week and sat in his usual seat.
      He was surprised how quickly he was getting used to the routine and he
      now thought of the chair as ‘his’ chair. Sometimes he wondered if anyone
      else ever sat in it, or if the room was only used once a week for
      him.</p>
    <p>But the thing that impressed him most about these counselling
      sessions was receiving the Heron’s full and undivided attention. Toad
      began to realise that he had never before received anyone’s full
      attention in his entire life. Whether he had ever given it to anyone was
      a question yet to be asked.</p>
    <p>The Heron listened to him attentively all the time. It was as if, for
      an hour, he centred himself entirely on Toad and focused on his
      situation to the exclusion of all else.</p>
    <p>Consequently, he found that he did not have to keep saying, ‘Do you
      see what I mean?’ or</p>
    <p>‘Have I made myself clear?’, which he habitually found himself using
      to excuse his waffle and imprecision.</p>
    <p>Providing that he, Toad, found the words to describe what he was
      thinking, the Heron listened and understood. But when he failed to
      understand, he would say so and then Toad would be forced to be more
      precise and search for other words and expressions which would convey
      his meaning more exactly.</p>
    <p>Somehow, the way in which the Heron listened to him and prodded him
      with questions enabled him to bring all sorts of thoughts and feelings
      to consciousness. Gradually he was beginning to explore and examine
      aspects of himself of which previously he had been unaware. In other
      words, Toad had started to learn.</p>
    <p>‘Well, Toad,’ said the Heron. ‘How are you feeling?’ This question no
      longer surprised him and in fact he was expecting it.</p>
    <p>‘I’m feeling different,’ he answered. ‘I’m still low in my spirits,
      but I keep finding myself thinking about our previous meeting, when you
      talked about the Child Ego State.</p>
    <p>Are we going to talk about it any more this time?’</p>
    <p>‘Yes,’ said the Heron. ‘I would like to explore that with you. But it
      means that I must change roles.’</p>
    <p>‘What do you mean?’ asked Toad.</p>
    <p>‘It means’, replied the Heron, ‘that I shall behave differently. If I
      am to teach you about the Child State, I must take on the role of the
      teacher. One of the differences will be that I shall be in a telling
      mode, rather than a listening mode. If I successfully teach you about
      the Child Ego State, then you will be able to use those ideas to explore
      your own self and your own experience. Remember, there is nothing so
      practical as a good theory!’</p>
    <p>As Toad was trying to puzzle out just what that meant, the Heron
      stood up and went to the flip-chart.</p>
    <p>‘The Child Ego State’, he began, ‘is made up of the archaic relics of
      our childhood. It consists of all the emotions we experienced when we
      were little. You must remember that at birth, we start out with only the
      very basic emotions. In our early years, these gradually develop into
      more subtle and complex patterns of behaviour which become central to
      our very self and form part of us, defining our behaviour for the rest
      of our lives. The result is that now, in particular situations and
      circumstances which are different for each of us, we respond
      automatically from that basic position. Once again, we act and feel like
      the child we once were.’</p>
    <p>‘Could you explain that a bit more, please?’ asked Toad.</p>
    <p>‘Certainly,’ replied the Heron. ‘I am suggesting that we are born
      with certain basic emotions, rather like the primary colours, which are
      similar for all babies. But as we develop as individuals, our feelings
      and responses become increasingly individualistic, just as basic colours
      mix together to create all sorts of subtle shades and hues. Does that
      make sense?’</p>
    <p>‘Yes,’ said Toad, ‘I can understand that.’</p>
    <p>‘Right then,’ answered the Heron. ‘What do you think these basic
      emotions are?’ Toad frowned and scratched his head, but was unable to
      come up with an answer.</p>
    <p>‘Look at it this way,’ said the Heron. ‘I know you are not married,
      but do you have any nephews or nieces?’</p>
    <p>‘Yes, of course,’ said the Toad, ‘I always remember their birthdays
      and I love taking them their presents at Christmas. In fact, I think
      they’re rather fond of me.’</p>
    <p>‘Good,’ replied the Heron. ‘So how would you define some of their
      basic emotions?’</p>
    <p>‘Well, they are usually rushing about all over the place, having fun.
      I don’t know where they get all that energy! And then when I arrive, all
      laden with presents, they throw themselves at me and give me the most
      tremendous kisses and hugs. Very cheering, really.</p>
    <p>Mind you,’ continued Toad, ‘it’s not just the presents. I get the
      same kind of welcome whenever I go. They’re just very affectionate.’</p>
    <p>‘I’m sure they are,’ said Heron. ‘Let’s write this up.’ So he went to
      the flip-chart and wrote the heading ‘Children’s Basic Emotions’ and
      underneath, ‘Fun and Affection’.</p>
    <p>‘Any others?’ the Heron asked.</p>
    <p>‘They can certainly get angry with each other,’ said Toad. ‘I’ve
      known them have the most terrible fights when I have had to separate
      them physically. They can be little devils.’</p>
    <p>‘So there’s another basic emotion,’ said Heron, and wrote ‘Anger’ on
      the chart.</p>
    <p>‘Oh yes,’ said the Toad, ‘I certainly agree with that’</p>
    <p>‘Can you think of any others?’ asked Heron.</p>
    <p>‘I’m a bit stuck,’ Toad replied, after a pause.</p>
    <p>‘Try thinking of it in another way,’ said the Heron. ‘What are the
      basic emotions we seem to be born with, which just come naturally,
      without having to be learnt?’</p>
    <p>‘I’m not sure if this is what you are after,’ said Toad, ‘but my
      little nephews and nieces can easily get upset and sad. I remember on my
      last visit, they were crying because their puppy had just died. I tried
      to comfort them, they were all in tears. But I wasn’t much help.</p>
    <p>Ended up crying myself. I’m really very soft-hearted, you know.’ Here
      Toad blew his nose and fiddled with his bow-tie and his eyes were bright
      with tears.</p>
    <p>‘That seems like a very basic emotion,’ said the Heron and wrote
      ‘Sadness’ on the list.</p>
    <p>‘Any others?’</p>
    <p>Toad shook his head. ‘I can’t think of one,’</p>
    <p>‘How about fear?’ asked the Heron. ‘In my experience, children can
      easily become scared and it’s very easy to frighten a child.
      Unbelievably, some adults seem to enjoy doing just that, but that’s
      another story. Anyhow, do you agree with fear?’</p>
    <p>‘Most certainly,’ Toad replied. ‘I can still remember waking up
      screaming from my first nightmare when I was very small. And no one
      taught me to behave like that. I just yelled.</p>
    <p>It came naturally.’</p>
    <p>‘Right,’ said the Heron. ‘So I think that completes our list,’ and he
      added ‘Fear’ to it. So this was what was finally written on the
      flip-chart: <span class="italic">Children’s Basic Emotions</span></p>
    <p>Fun and Affection</p>
    <p>Anger</p>
    <p>Sadness</p>
    <p>Fear</p>
    <p>‘All of these emotions added together make up what is called the
      “Natural Child” and this forms a significant part of the total Child Ego
      State,’ said the Counsellor.</p>
    <p>‘So’, said Toad, ‘when I see someone being affectionate, or getting
      angry or sad or frightened, I can say that they are in their Natural
      Child. Is that right?’</p>
    <p>‘Exactly.’ said the Heron, ‘although anger is more complex and we
      shall learn more about that particular emotion later on.’</p>
    <p>‘And people can be in their Child State no matter how old they are?’
      asked Toad.</p>
    <p>‘Most certainly,’ replied the Heron. ‘People get into their Child
      State and feel and act exactly the same as they did when they were
      little, quite irrespective of their chronological age.’</p>
    <p>There was a long silence as Toad fell into deep thought. Finally he
      spoke.</p>
    <p>‘I think’, he said, ‘that I am often in the Child Ego State,’ and
      lapsed back into silence.</p>
    <p>‘But’, said Heron, ‘that’s only half the picture.’</p>
    <p>‘What do you mean?’ said Toad. ‘Is there more to be said about this
      Child Ego State?’</p>
    <p>‘There certainly is,’ replied Heron. ‘A great deal more. As we have
      seen, a child’s natural behaviour is a mixture of these basic emotions,’
      and he pointed to the list on the flip-chart.</p>
    <p>‘For instance, a baby will scream for food and attention, drink as
      much milk as it can get and then sleep when it is replete and content.
      All those natural feelings come into operation from day one and as the
      baby grows physically stronger so its emotional life develops and
      becomes more powerful.</p>
    <p>‘But there are other factors which come into play. And the most
      important of these is the baby’s parents. They impinge on its
      consciousness right from the beginning. Almost everything the baby does
      causes some response from its mother or father and these have a profound
      influence on the child.</p>
    <p>‘Usually a mother responds to her baby’s cry with love and comforting
      behaviour. But parents can act in an unloving way. The mother may be
      tired or even ill and respond harshly.</p>
    <p>Or the father may have strict views on how children should be reared
      and may deliberately ignore the baby’s cries for fear of “spoiling”
      it.’</p>
    <p>‘It makes you realise just how vulnerable babies are,’ Toad said
      thoughtfully. ‘I never realised before just what power people have over
      their children. They have total dominion.</p>
    <p>They can love them or reject them, cuddle them or abuse them. It’s
      just a lottery what sort of parents you get’</p>
    <p>He sat very quietly, thinking deeply about his own childhood, trying
      to remember what it felt like. After a while, the Heron spoke again.</p>
    <p>‘You’re quite right, Toad,’ he said. ‘Most parents try to do their
      best and very few want anything but good for their children. But parents
      are only human and they inevitably pass on their beliefs and behaviours
      to their offspring as surely as they pass on their genes. And children
      just have to learn to cope and defend themselves from the
      consequences.’</p>
    <p>‘But how can they learn to cope?’ asked Toad, now quite animated and
      obviously thinking hard. ‘Babies and little children can’t think
      logically. They can’t sit down and plan how to cope with their mother’s
      or father’s behaviour.’ He said this quite strongly, as if he was
      dealing, not with an abstruse point of child psychology, but with
      something deeply personal. As indeed he was.</p>
    <p>‘Well, of course a baby or an infant can’t think through these issues
      logically or consciously,’ said Heron. ‘But what they do is to learn
      through experience. This kind of learning involves not just our brains
      but our total self. What we learn is a strategy for living.</p>
    <p>We develop behaviours which enable us to cope with our parents and
      others. And if we are lucky, we have enough energy left over to enjoy
      life.</p>
    <p>‘This means that every baby must learn how to adapt his or her basic
      behaviour to cope with their primal situation. These adaptations become
      the nucleus around which the rest of our behaviour grows and develops.
      Of course, we are influenced by many other events later in our lives.
      But these earliest experiences shape the beginning of us and we can
      never deny or forget them.’</p>
    <p>‘Could you slow down a bit?’ pleaded Toad. ‘Just when I think that I
      have grasped something, you go on to something else.’</p>
    <p>‘I’m sorry,’ smiled the Heron. ‘I know that I tend to go on a bit
      about this, but I believe it to be of the greatest importance. In all
      our work together, Toad, understanding your childhood is the key to
      understanding yourself. As Freud said, “Where there is Id, there shall
      Ego be.” But I’ll explain that later. Now Toad, what was it in
      particular that you did not understand?’</p>
    <p>‘You said that as we learn to cope with our lives as infants, we have
      to make “adaptations” to our natural behaviour. What does that
      mean?’</p>
    <p>‘That’s an excellent question,’ answered Heron. ‘Let me answer by
      telling you a short story. It’s science fiction, so you can let your
      imagination run free.</p>
    <p>‘Imagine a small planet on which there are only three living beings,
      yourself and two others. These two other beings are more than twice your
      height and you are completely dependent on them for everything. This
      includes not only your food but also your emotional needs. Usually they
      treat you well and then you respond by loving them. But sometimes they
      get angry with you and this makes you feel frightened and unhappy. And
      because they are so big and powerful, you feel helpless. What do you
      think about that?’</p>
    <p>‘I don’t much like that story,’ answered Toad. ‘If that was me, I
      would build a spaceship and escape from those two creatures as fast as I
      could.’</p>
    <p><img src="./images/00004.jpg" class="calibre_3" /></p>
    <p>‘Unfortunately, you can’t escape. So you are just going to have to
      put up with the situation and learn how to cope as best you can.’</p>
    <p>‘In other words,’ said Toad, who had caught on to the real meaning of
      the story, ‘I shall have to learn to adapt my behaviour to this
      particular situation.’</p>
    <p>‘Well done,’ replied Heron. ‘You really are learning now. For as you
      have realised, my story is a parable of infancy. We start our lives with
      only two, or sometimes only one other person in our life. They are so
      much bigger than us and we are totally dependent on them.</p>
    <p>As there is no escape, our only option is to adapt to their every
      whim. Let me draw a simple diagram to illustrate this.’</p>
    <p>He went to the flip-chart and drew a circle and wrote above it, ‘The
      Child Ego State’.</p>
    <p>Then he divided the circle in half with a horizontal line. In the top
      half he wrote ‘Natural Child’. In the bottom half he wrote ‘Adapted
      Child’. It looked like this:</p>
    <p>‘Now Toad,’ said Heron, ‘we must finish here. It’s been a very full
      session and I am sure it has given you a lot to think about. So let me
      give you some homework for our next meeting.’</p>
    <p>‘Oh no,’ said Toad. looking quite anxious, ‘not homework! I always
      hated doing prep.</p>
    <p>I don’t think I shall be able to do any this week. In fact I’ve just
      remembered I have a lot of work to do. I will probably have to go up to
      town. And lots of other things,’ he added lamely. There was a long
      silence.</p>
    <p>‘Just as a matter of interest,’ said Heron, ‘how would you analyse
      what you have just said to me?’</p>
    <p>‘Well,’ said Toad, ‘I simply told you why I am unable to do any
      homework,’ He looked uneasy and found it difficult to meet Heron’s
      eye.</p>
    <p>‘Yes, but how do you think it sounded to me?’</p>
    <p>Toad shifted in his chair. ‘I don’t know really. I merely gave you
      the reasons why I can’t do it.’</p>
    <p>‘Were they reasons?’ asked Heron. There was a long pause. Then Toad
      spoke.</p>
    <p>‘Perhaps you thought they sounded like excuses?’</p>
    <p>‘What do you think?’ asked Heron.</p>
    <p>‘I can understand you thinking that,’ answered Toad, ‘but the word
      “homework” gives me very bad feelings. I can remember exactly how I felt
      at school in the evenings trying to learn Latin verbs or memorise
      poetry. And then the fear of punishment the next morning if you got it
      wrong.’</p>
    <p>‘So what state were you in when I suggested homework to you just
      now?’ asked Heron.</p>
    <p>‘Child,’ replied Toad instantly. ‘All those old fears and anxieties
      came sweeping over me. Is there something wrong with me, Heron, that I
      should behave like that?’</p>
    <p>‘No, of course not,’ said Heron warmly. ‘We all have words or
      situations which trigger off our childhood feelings. I suppose the most
      commonly shared word that can do this is “dentist”.’</p>
    <p>‘Oh no, not the dentist!’ said Toad, clutching his jaw in mock
      agony.</p>
    <p>‘So I will avoid the dreaded “homework” word,’ said Heron, ‘and
      instead ask you simply to do some work before our next meeting.’</p>
    <p>‘What kind of work?’ asked Toad, still a little on the defensive.</p>
    <p>‘Just think about your own childhood. Think about those early days
      and your earliest memories. And then we can see if our work here throws
      any light on them. Goodbye Toad.</p>
    <p>I look forward to seeing you next week.’</p>
    <p><span class="bold">6 </span></p>
    <p><span class="bold">Toad explores his childhood</span></p>
    <p>Toad found the days following that last meeting strange and
      unsettling. He found himself remembering long-forgotten incidents in his
      childhood. Well-remembered events were rehearsed over and over in his
      mind, and memories of his parents and also of his grandparents were
      never far away. He went up to the attic and found an old album of
      sepia-tinted family photographs. These evoked a great sadness in him,
      not so much because the people in it were no longer alive, but because
      he featured in so few of them.</p>
    <p>He remembered his stern, demanding father, who always gave Toad the
      impression that he, Toad, did not come up to his high standards and,
      what’s more, never would. He remembered a world inhabited by big,
      successful men, all of whom, it seemed to Toad, had achieved great
      things in their different spheres. His paternal grandfather had started
      the family brewing company, followed by his father when, in turn, he
      became head of the family. Toad remembered being taken around the
      brewery as a child and being frightened by the noise and the steam and
      the smell. He knew then that he would be expected to work in that horrid
      place, and yet even then he realised that he never could.</p>
    <p>He remembered his mother, a quiet person who was dominated by her
      husband as she had been dominated by her father. He had been an eminent
      cleric and, eventually, a suffragan bishop. Henceforth he was always
      referred to as ‘The Bishop’, even by his daughter. Toad remembered a
      tall person with an imposing presence and large pectoral cross who
      always said, in a tone of delighted surprise, ‘Ah, little cakes!’ when
      tea was served.</p>
    <p>He remembered that at times his mother could be full of fun. Yet Toad
      felt that she was always conscious of her husband’s appraisal and
      constantly checking for signs of his disapproval. As a result, she would
      often withdraw her affection from Toad in order to avoid her husband’s
      displeasure and conform to his stricter views. He remembered very few
      cuddles.</p>
    <p>As the day of the next counselling session drew near, Toad felt a
      mixture of emotions which he had not experienced before. His main
      feeling was sadness and depression, remembering as he did an unhappy and
      lonely childhood where there was not a great deal of love or happiness.
      But even so, he could recall people, rather like ‘bit’ players, who had
      made brief entrances into his life, and who unwittingly delineated
      behaviours and aroused emotions which indicated the ‘otherness’ of
      things.</p>
    <p>This happened mainly at Christmas time, when a variety of people paid
      their annual respects and brought presents and hoped to receive dark
      bottles brought up from the brewery cellars. He remembered an aged aunt
      with a large black hat secured by enormous hatpins which he assumed must
      be stuck right through her head. Then there was a strange, jolly person
      who did conjuring tricks and once, when alone with Toad and to his great
      amazement, lit his farts. And there was an aged uncle with a gold
      watch-chain hung across a large stomach, who gave Toad a sovereign and
      squeezed his thigh in a very horrid way.</p>
    <p>And underlying all these memories which came unbidden into Toad’s
      mind, there was growing a strong yet impotent anger. Impotent, because
      he wasn’t sure who he was angry with or what he was angry about.</p>
    <p>The result was that he began to feel guilty about feeling angry! For
      he knew in his heart of hearts, although he would probably not tell this
      even to Heron, that he was extremely angry with his parents. This anger,
      however, presented him with problems which he was finding difficult to
      resolve. Presumably, his parents had done their best for him when he was
      a child and here he was now, in a beautiful house which he had inherited
      from them.</p>
    <p>They had also made sure he was more than adequately provided for. To
      make it even more difficult, both his parents had been dead for some
      time! So just as Toad had found it difficult to be angry with them when
      they were alive, he found it totally impossible now they were dead! But
      the angry feelings would not go away. Consequently, it was a very
      emotional Toad who rang the doorbell of the Heronry and took his
      accustomed seat in the study.</p>
    <p>‘Good morning, Toad,’ said Heron. ‘How has your week been?’</p>
    <p>‘I’m not too sure,’ Toad answered quietly. ‘I’m frightened that I am
      beginning to feel depressed again and that worries me, because I thought
      I was feeling better.’</p>
    <p>‘What do you think has made you feel like this?’ asked Heron.</p>
    <p>‘I think it is because of the “homework” you asked me to do,’ Toad
      replied. ‘I have found it very painful to recall parts of my childhood
      and that is why I am feeling sad.’ And Toad, for the first time in some
      while, burst into tears.</p>
    <p>Heron passed the box of tissues and Toad took one and wiped his eyes.
      Then he took another and blew his nose vigorously.</p>
    <p>After a pause, Heron asked him if he was feeling better.</p>
    <p>‘Yes,’ said Toad. ‘Surprisingly I do.’</p>
    <p>‘You see,’ said Heron, ‘there is a real and discernible reason for
      your current sadness.</p>
    <p>You recalled unhappy times and you responded quite naturally by
      feeling sad and unhappy.</p>
    <p>And so you cried. Can you accept that explanation?’</p>
    <p>‘I suppose so,’ said Toad, sniffing, ‘but I don’t like blubbing like
      that.’</p>
    <p>‘I’m sure you don’t,’ said Heron, ‘but if you want to understand more
      about yourself, you need to get in touch with your feelings and
      understand them. Otherwise, you deny them, either by ignoring or
      suppressing them. The result can be rather like an amputation. A vital
      part of you is severed and effectively you are disabled—to a greater or
      lesser extent.’</p>
    <p>‘So it’s alright to cry?’ asked Toad. ‘I remember Father being very
      strict about it. If I cried, he used to say, “Now stop that blubbing at
      once or I shall be extremely angry.” So of course, I would stop.’</p>
    <p>‘You have the choice,’ said Heron very seriously. ‘Will you obey the
      voice of your dead father, or will you give yourself permission and take
      your own authority?’</p>
    <p>‘That seems a very stark way of putting things,’ said Toad, looking
      uncomfortable.</p>
    <p>‘After all, I’m only wondering about crying or not. It seems overly
      dramatic to talk about the “voice of my dead father”, don’t you
      think?’</p>
    <p>‘It may well be,’ answered Heron, ‘but we are working on dramatic
      events. From your simple question flow many other important issues that
      can have a profound effect on your learning and, therefore, on the rest
      of your life.’</p>
    <p>Toad had by now become extremely attentive. His tears had dried up
      and he was alert and actively listening. ‘Go on then, Heron,’ he said,
      ‘I’m listening.’</p>
    <p>‘Good,’ responded Heron. ‘In that case, I shall take up my teaching
      role again in order to provide you with more insight into yourself. Do
      you remember our discussion about the Child Ego State, made up of the
      Natural and the Adapted Child?’</p>
    <p>‘I certainly do,’ said Toad. ‘It has had a profound effect on me and
      I hoped we were going to talk more about it today. I’m ready for
      it.’</p>
    <p>‘I believe you are,’ said Heron, ‘so here goes. Toad, who were the
      most influential people in your childhood?’</p>
    <p>‘That’s easy,’ replied Toad. ‘My mother and father, of course. And in
      the background, my grandparents.’</p>
    <p>‘Let us concentrate on your parents first. What sort of a person was
      your father?’</p>
    <p>Toad answered unhesitatingly. ‘Stern and upright. I remember him
      always telling me off about something or other. He would look at me in a
      very disapproving way and say,</p>
    <p>“Theophilus, how many times have I got to tell you? Don’t do that!”
      He was always reproving and criticising me. Gradually I grew to accept
      that he was always right and I was always wrong. And so it seemed
      logical that he should tell me off.’</p>
    <p>‘Would he ever hit you?’ asked Heron.</p>
    <p>‘Oh no,’ answered Toad. ‘There was no need for that. One look from
      Father was enough!</p>
    <p>And he would stop being affectionate towards me. Not that he was ever
      very affectionate.</p>
    <p>His most severe punishment was to say in an icy voice, “Go to your
      room and don’t come down until you are ready to apologise!”</p>
    <p>‘I can remember a few occasions when he played with me. But they
      always ended badly.</p>
    <p>Perhaps because I was so desperate to be loved by him, I would get
      silly and do something foolish. I can remember once when this happened,
      he pushed me off his knee and said to Mother, “I can’t stand it when he
      behaves like this,” and walked out of the room. I just burst into
      tears.’</p>
    <p>After a pause, during which Toad’s eyes were bright with unshed
      tears, Heron asked,</p>
    <p>‘And what of your mother?’</p>
    <p>‘She was very much under the thumb of Father, but I always felt
      closer to her than to him.</p>
    <p>She would occasionally cuddle me, but not much. If I came running to
      her when Father had been horrid she would say, “Now don’t be silly,
      dear, I’m sure he didn’t mean it”.</p>
    <p>‘Because I was her only child, I think she found it difficult to
      treat me other than as a baby.</p>
    <p>She embarrassed me terribly at school when she visited me on Sports
      Days and would insist on calling me “Dear little Theo” in front of the
      other boys and try to comb my hair.’</p>
    <p>‘And did things improve as you grew up?’ asked Heron.</p>
    <p>‘Oh no, not at all,’ answered Toad. ‘For instance, when I was at
      university and invited some friends to stay, my Father would always find
      something to criticise whilst Mother would succeed yet again in
      embarrassing me. She once asked, in front of my friends, if I had put on
      clean underclothes that day! I can laugh now but I can assure you it was
      not funny at the time.</p>
    <p>‘And’, continued Toad, ‘I’ll tell you a story that may interest you.
      Once, not so long before she died, I plucked up courage and said to her,
      “Mother, when will you stop treating me like a little boy?” And do you
      know what she said?’</p>
    <p>‘I think I can guess,’ said Heron, ‘but tell me.’</p>
    <p>‘She said, “I’ll stop treating you like a little boy when you stop
      behaving like one!”</p>
    <p>There seemed to be no answer to this, so I walked out of the
      room.’</p>
    <p>‘That must have made you feel very angry,’ said the Heron, after a
      pause.</p>
    <p>‘Oh no,’ said Toad, ‘I never get angry. I’m not the type,’ and he
      smiled weakly.</p>
    <p>‘So how do you deal with your angry feelings?’ asked Heron.</p>
    <p>Toad sat up straight and swallowed hard. ‘Er, um, what exactly do you
      mean by anger?’</p>
    <p>‘Oh, come on Toad,’ said the Heron impatiently. ‘You know what anger
      is. How do you deal with it? When were you last angry?’</p>
    <p>Toad was thrown into confusion. First, he hadn’t been thinking about
      anger at that moment and, second, he found it difficult to admit to
      feeling angry at any time. He had always felt as if he would be punished
      if anyone knew he was angry. The result was that he swallowed his angry
      feelings and felt extremely guilty instead. But why should Heron
      suddenly start on this particular subject? Thinking about anger made
      Toad feel very anxious and he wanted to change the subject. But there
      was Heron looking intently at him and waiting for an answer. Toad felt
      he had no choice but to continue.</p>
    <p>‘To be honest, I’m not sure when I was last angry. Come to think of
      it, I rarely if ever get angry. It seems so unnecessary and I don’t
      think it’s my style.’ He smiled a placatory smile.</p>
    <p>‘Well,’ said Heron, ‘I think you may find it helpful if you <span class="italic">did</span> think about it. After
      all, you have already
      agreed that it’s one of the basic emotions with which we are all
      born.</p>
    <p>Look at it this way, Toad. What do you think happened when you got
      angry as a child?’</p>
    <p>Toad considered this question and remembered his father, tall, stern
      and forbidding.</p>
    <p>Behind him, in the shadows as it were, stood his grandfathers, men of
      character and probity, their very presence spelling out the highest
      standards of morality. Toad felt that their influence had dominated his
      life, just as their portraits dominated the Library at Toad Hall.</p>
    <p>‘I suppose’, said Toad, ‘that when I remember those early days it’s
      my parents’ anger I remember, not my own. I was always being told what
      to do. Father frequently got angry with me when I misbehaved.’</p>
    <p>‘So,’ said the Heron, ‘when a child has stern and critical parents,
      it must learn to cope with them and adapt its natural behaviour to deal
      best with that situation. What is such a child likely to do?’</p>
    <p>‘Does this mean we are back to the Adapted Child State again?’ asked
      Toad.</p>
    <p>‘Precisely,’ answered Heron. ‘You will remember that, in the Natural
      Child, each of us has our basic emotions which are comparable to the
      primary colours on an artist’s palette.</p>
    <p>But then we must learn to adapt this natural behaviour to our
      particular circumstances, ton-ing the colours down in order to survive
      and preserve our personal integrity. This means, amongst many other
      factors, learning how to cope with anger, the anger of our parents and
      our own anger.’ He paused. ‘How do you feel about that, Toad?’</p>
    <p>‘That’s quite difficult to imagine,’ Toad replied thoughtfully, ‘I’m
      thinking about your idea of emotions as colours. I am trying to imagine
      painting a picture which depicts the struggle between the child with its
      developing emotions and feelings and its parents. They have such fixed
      ideas about right and wrong and are immeasurably stronger. How does any
      child survive this battle?’</p>
    <p>‘You think that growing up must always be a battle?’ asked Heron.</p>
    <p>‘Well, I think it probably was in my case,’ Toad answered. ‘I think
      there must have been very strong pressures on me when I was little and I
      had to cope with critical parents.’ He paused and there was complete
      silence, broken only by the ticking of the grandfather clock in the
      corner of the room. Then after a while, Toad said in a small voice, ‘I
      wonder how I learnt to cope with all of that?’</p>
    <p>‘To discover that,’ said the Heron, ‘let us use our brains and be
      logical and let me ask you this question. How is a person likely to
      respond if he is victimised and bullied by someone much stronger than
      himself and cannot escape?’</p>
    <p>Toad thought for a while and then said, ‘If such a person is really
      powerless, he or she must learn to go along with the oppressor.
      Otherwise I suppose life would be made unbearable.’</p>
    <p>‘Exactly’, said Heron, ‘so is it not likely that when <span class="italic">you</span> were a child, you had to
      learn
      how to comply
      with your parents’ strict wishes and demands?’ After some time, Toad
      agreed that that was probably the case.</p>
    <p>‘So’, said Heron, ‘what did you have to do?’</p>
    <p>Toad thought about this for some time. Within himself, he was feeling
      sad and unhappy as he remembered those distant times. But, although
      their source was so far away, those memories and feelings were as alive
      in his consciousness as if they were happening in the present. However,
      another part of himself felt alert and challenged and able to think
      about these matters objectively without being affected by them.</p>
    <p>‘I suppose,’ he said slowly, ‘if you are forced to comply with
      someone, it means that you don’t argue with them. You go along with what
      they say and agree with them.’</p>
    <p>‘Good,’ said Heron. ‘I’m going to write this down because I think you
      are discovering something of great importance.’ He went to the
      flip-chart and wrote the heading ‘Compliant Behaviour’, and underneath,
      ‘Agreeing’.</p>
    <p>‘Anything else?’ he asked.</p>
    <p>Toad pondered for a while. ‘I think that as well as going along with
      my parents’ wishes, I always wanted to please them. I’m not sure if I
      ever succeeded, but I remember clearly wanting them to be pleased and
      proud of me.’ He paused for a while, again deep in thought.</p>
    <p>‘Perhaps that is why I developed a tendency to show off. They never
      seemed pleased or impressed with what I did, so I indulged in
      extravagant and stupid behaviour to try and gain their attention. Is
      that likely, Heron?’</p>
    <p>Heron looked intensely at Toad and realised that, at that moment,
      Toad’s voice and appearance exactly complemented his words. For he
      looked and sounded, and clearly felt, like a very sad child. This
      sadness affected the Heron deeply. He sat quietly and tried to share
      Toad’s memories and to experience his sadness, in as far as one person
      can ever feel what another is feeling. This is called empathy. Toad felt
      this unspoken support and understanding and it strengthened him to his
      very soul.</p>
    <p>After a while, the Heron said, ‘I think you are probably right,
      Toad,’ and then was quiet again, as he sat beside Toad at his pool of
      loneliness.</p>
    <p>‘Well now,’ said Heron after a while when he judged the time was
      right, ‘we must press on. Earlier you were saying that you were always
      wanting to please your parents. Shall I add this to our list of
      compliant behaviour?’</p>
    <p>‘Oh yes,’ said Toad, his voice stronger now. ‘And there’s another
      thing you can write down: “Apologising”. I know I do that now and I know
      I did it as a child. Almost before I had done anything, I would
      apologise in order to placate Father.’</p>
    <p>‘Why don’t <span class="italic">you</span> write this up?’ asked
      Heron.</p>
    <p>So for the first time Toad took the crayon and added ‘Apologising’ to
      the list. Then he turned to Heron and said, ‘You know, I am beginning to
      realise this list describes not only my past, but also my present. What
      I learnt to do then is curiously close to how I behave now. I don’t know
      if that surprises me or not.’</p>
    <p>‘I suppose what <span class="italic">is</span> surprising’, answered
      Heron, ‘is to realise just how much of our adult behaviour was learnt in
      childhood. But when you think about it, it is fairly obvious. The
      strongest feelings we had as children inevitably become those we
      regularly experience as adults. Perhaps that was what the poet meant
      when he wrote “The child is father of the man”. And I would like to add
      one further item to our list, if you agree.’</p>
    <p>‘What’s that?’ asked Toad.</p>
    <p>‘Dependency,’ answered Heron.</p>
    <p>After a pause, Toad said, ‘Are you sure about that? I mean, aren’t
      all children dependent on their parents? Isn’t that the natural way of
      behaving when you are small and helpless?’</p>
    <p>‘Yes it is,’ answered Heron, ‘but for most people, the very essence
      of growing up is to lessen and finally break those ties of dependency
      and become an independent and autonomous person. Few achieve this
      totally, some achieve it partially and many remain dependent all their
      lives.’</p>
    <p>‘But what has this to do with compliant behaviour?’ asked Toad,
      somewhat cautiously.</p>
    <p>‘What I mean,’ said the Heron, ‘is that compliant behaviour can
      result in someone learning to be dependent as a way of life. In other
      words, they never really grow up.’</p>
    <p>‘You mean like me, I suppose,’ said Toad, and he started to
      giggle.</p>
    <p>‘Yes, I suppose I do,’ said Heron, and for the first time, he too
      started to laugh. It was a rather dry sound, as if he did not indulge in
      laughter very often. But it was a genuine laugh and it enabled Toad to
      turn his rather irritating giggles into proper laughter.</p>
    <p>‘Sorry about that,’ said Toad, wiping his eyes, ‘but we have been so
      serious and suddenly it all seemed so ludicrous. I just had to
      laugh.’</p>
    <p>‘Please don’t apologise,’ said Heron. ‘It’s time we finished anyway
      and how nice that we can do so on a happy note.’ This time, Heron walked
      with Toad to the door and, as he was leaving, turned to him and said,
      ‘Toad, I believe you are making progress. There is still much to be done
      but you have set your feet firmly on the path of learning and you can
      never go back.’ And with a friendly wave, Heron shut the door. Toad
      walked home along the river bank and felt happier than he had done for a
      very long time.</p>
    <p><span class="bold">7 </span></p>
    <p><span class="bold">Toad meets the Rebellious Child</span></p>
    <p>In the week before the next session, Toad thought a great deal about
      his own anger and, on the whole, found that he linked it with feelings
      of guilt. Apart from his father, the person who had been most angry with
      him in his adult life had been Badger. Badger, that large, strong animal
      who, ages ago, had tried to stop him enjoying motorcars and had spoken
      to him so sternly that he had shed bitter tears of remorse and promised
      to reform. And a lot of good that had done! Toad realised with a flash
      of insight that Badger could never be a counsellor—because he never
      listened. Like all angry people, he wanted to <span class="italic">tell</span> others what to do and then
      criticise
      them for
      their shortcomings.</p>
    <p>Toad remembered and relived and reviewed one particular situation
      with Badger. It had happened some years ago when he had been going
      through a rather difficult time. He had had one or two nasty car crashes
      when one day, out of the blue, Badger descended on him with Rat and Mole
      and proceeded to try to make him change his life.</p>
    <p>He remembered Badger taking him into the smoking-room at Toad Hall
      and giving him the severest of moral lectures, reducing Toad to
      penitence and tears. But when it was over and the severe Badger became a
      more kindly father-figure, Toad’s natural resilience had reasserted
      itself.</p>
    <p>At the time Badger wanted him to confess his sins to Rat and Mole and
      publicly admit the error of his ways. Well, of course he wouldn’t. Toad
      remembered the situation perfectly and recalled his exact words.</p>
    <p>‘No,’ he had said. ‘I’m not sorry. And it wasn’t folly at all. It was
      simply glorious!’ He had added impatiently, when Badger appeared
      scandalised at his words, ‘Oh yes, <span class="italic">in there,</span>
      I would have said anything <span class="italic">in there! </span>’</p>
    <p>And so he would. For Toad realised that his apparent penitential
      response had been, in fact, a defence against Badger’s attack. It
      certainly had not come from the heart, and it did not represent a true
      change. ‘But,’ thought Toad, ‘there I go again. It’s always someone else
      who gets angry never me. I wonder why?’</p>
    <p>Eventually, the counselling day came round again and Toad found
      himself once more facing his counsellor in the familiar room at the
      Heronry.</p>
    <p>‘Good morning Toad,’ commenced the Heron. ‘How are you in your
      spirits today?’</p>
    <p>‘I am feeling a bit happier, I think,’ replied Toad. ‘I am sleeping
      better and taking a keener interest in things. For instance, I have
      started to take a daily paper again and I really read it. At one time, I
      just couldn’t be bothered to open one.’</p>
    <p>‘That’s very good,’ the Heron responded. ‘And where would you say you
      are on our Feelings Thermometer?’ He rustled through the flip-sheets and
      turned up the diagram which he had drawn at their first meeting. It was
      simply a vertical line with one at the bottom and ten at the top.</p>
    <p>‘I think I feel at about five or six,’ said Toad.</p>
    <p>‘And can you see where you were at our original meeting?’ asked
      Heron, and he pointed to where Toad had placed his mark all those weeks
      ago. It was between one and two. There was a pause, which Toad
      experienced as quite a friendly silence, as they looked at each
      other.</p>
    <p>Eventually Toad spoke. ‘Heron,’ he said, ‘am I allowed to set the
      agenda for this meeting?’</p>
    <p>‘Of course you are. I shall be delighted if you do,’ answered Heron.
      ‘But in a real sense you have always set the agenda. At each of our
      meetings, I have always attempted to help you work on those issues which
      will provide you with the greatest insights and learning. If you are now
      able to identify these yourself, then we are really making
      progress.’</p>
    <p>‘Well,’ answered Toad, ‘I want to analyse my own anger. Or, more
      correctly, my lack of it. At our last meeting, we looked at how I had
      adapted my behaviour to cope with my critical parents and you called
      this “compliant behaviour”.’</p>
    <p>‘Yes, I remember,’ said Heron. ‘It’s still on the flip-chart. He
      selected the page headed ‘Compliant Behaviour’, underneath which was
      written, ‘Agreeing.’ ‘Pleasing.’</p>
    <p>‘Apologising.’ ‘Dependency’. ‘I suggested this was how you defended
      yourself from your parents’ anger and aggression. So what is your
      question, Toad?’</p>
    <p>‘It’s really quite simple, but I can’t find the answer. Why <span class="italic">don’t </span> I get angry?
      That’s
      all.’</p>
    <p>‘Have you never been angry?’ asked Heron.</p>
    <p>‘Well, never like Badger. When he’s angry, he looks stern and severe
      and his voice gets loud and angry and he points his finger at you. I
      tell you, he can frighten the life out of me!’</p>
    <p>‘And you are never like that?’ asked Heron.</p>
    <p>Toad thought hard. ‘I suppose there was one time. That was when my
      friends and I fought the Wildwooders who had occupied my house. I was so
      angry I uttered war whoops and went straight for the chief weasel. I
      whacked him really hard and drove him out, along with the rest of them.
      But that was a very unusual situation. When it was all over, I felt so
      tired I couldn’t get up the next day until lunchtime. It was very much
      against my nature. I’m not really a fighter.</p>
    <p>But I have to say that I am proud of what I did on that evening. In
      fact, <span class="italic">very</span> proud.’</p>
    <p>‘You have every right to be,’ said Heron, warmly. ‘But I still do not
      know exactly the issue which is concerning you. Can you state your
      question more precisely?’</p>
    <p>‘Yes, I can,’ said Toad. ‘A couple of sessions ago you said—and I
      agreed with you—that anger is one of our basic emotions. I recall you
      said that these basic emotions are like the primary colours on an
      artist’s palette. So my question is, ‘if anger is a basic constituent of
      my behaviour, why don’t I get angry?”’</p>
    <p>‘That really is an excellent question, Toad,’ said Heron. ‘However,
      like all good questions, the answer is likely to give you possibly
      painful insights into yourself. Are you ready for this?’</p>
    <p>Toad looked steadily at Heron. ‘I have gone this far,’ he said. ‘I
      can’t stop now.’</p>
    <p>‘Right,’ said Heron. ‘Perhaps the best way to begin is to use our
      brains and our reason, even though the question is all about feelings
      and emotions. Let us start by imagining the following situation. You are
      being held captive by benevolent despots. They have complete dominion
      over you, yet at the same time they look after you and take care of you.
      How would you feel about that?’</p>
    <p>‘I think I would have very mixed feelings about them,’ said Toad.</p>
    <p>‘Exactly! And <span class="italic">that’s</span> what you experienced
      when you were little. How could you be angry with these kindly despots,
      your parents, who clearly had the upper hand and on whom you were
      totally dependent? And whom you loved.’</p>
    <p>Toad sat very still, deep in thought. ‘It does seem to be a genuine
      dilemma,’ he said.</p>
    <p>‘So what would have happened when the force of my anger met the
      apparently invincible power of my parents?’</p>
    <p>‘It seems to me,’ said Heron, ‘that there can only be one possible
      answer.’</p>
    <p>‘And what is that?’ asked Toad.</p>
    <p>‘You had to learn how to be angry non-aggressively!’</p>
    <p>‘But that’s impossible,’ Toad replied quickly. ‘Surely, being angry
      <span class="italic">means</span> being aggressive, by definition. Isn’t
      it more likely that I learnt to suppress my anger totally?’
    </p>
    <p>‘I doubt that very much,’ answered Heron. ‘Anger is such an integral
      part of our behaviour that it can never be totally suppressed. Let’s use
      another metaphor, this time from science.</p>
    <p>Imagine a cylinder of gas which has started to heat up. The pressure
      is increasing and there is danger of an explosion. What can be done
      quickly to reduce the pressure?’</p>
    <p>‘The first thing you could do,’ answered Toad, ‘and the most obvious,
      is to open the valve as far as possible and vent the gas to the
      atmosphere in a great, powerful jet’</p>
    <p>‘Quite so,’ said Heron. ‘And this is just how some people learn to
      deal with their anger.</p>
    <p>They release it like a powerful jet of gas, directed at a chosen
      target, and then resume their normal behaviour. What they forget, or
      deliberately avoid noticing, is the damage they cause and the adverse
      effect this behaviour has on their relationships.’</p>
    <p>‘So anger <span class="italic">is</span> aggressive, like I said?’
      asked Toad, anxious not to lose his point.</p>
    <p>‘Yes, it certainly is in this example and that is what I wanted to
      illustrate. But now, consider this. Think once again about that gas
      cylinder getting hot and the pressure building up inside. Is there
      another way to reduce the pressure, perhaps less dramatically?’</p>
    <p>‘I suppose if you wanted to be more careful, you could simply open
      the valve slowly and let the gas seep out over a period of time. Is that
      what you are thinking?’</p>
    <p>‘Indeed it is,’ said Heron. ‘Don’t you see, Toad? You are discovering
      the answer! What you and many other people have learnt, is how to be
      angry non-aggressively. You adopted ways of letting your anger out
      slowly and gently, almost imperceptibly, so as not to upset anyone.’</p>
    <p>‘But how?’ asked Toad plaintively. ‘I can’t remember behaving like
      that’</p>
    <p>‘Well,’ said the Heron, ‘do you remember ever throwing a
      tantrum?’</p>
    <p>‘What, is that really anger?’ asked Toad in some surprise. ‘I mean,
      tantrums are really pointless and don’t achieve anything,’</p>
    <p>‘My dear Toad,’ Heron said patiently, ‘that’s just the point.
      Tantrums are a childish display of anger, often as a response to someone
      saying “No you can’t!” to a child. This makes the child very angry, yet
      at the same time it feels powerless to be violent or aggressive towards
      the person who has caused their anger. All it can do is to lie on the
      floor and kick and scream. When adults do this, it is sometimes called
      “throwing a wobbly”.’</p>
    <p>‘Hum,’ said Toad, ‘I suppose I have thrown a few of those in my time.
      But’, he added,</p>
    <p>‘not recently.’ Then he continued, ‘You said that these forms of
      non-aggressive anger were spread over time. A tantrum may not last very
      long,’</p>
    <p>‘That’s true,’ answered Heron, ‘although some tantrums can go on for
      a long time. Let’s think of a response that can last for hours and even
      days.’</p>
    <p>‘Like what?’ asked Toad.</p>
    <p>‘How about sulking?’</p>
    <p>‘Sulking?’ repeated Toad. ‘I never thought of sulking as a way of
      being angry’</p>
    <p>‘Well, I believe it is,’ replied Heron. ‘Sulking is sullen, morose
      behaviour where the sulker is unusually quiet. I think, Toad, that of
      all the Adapted Child’s behaviours sulking is the best illustration of
      using time to reduce the force of anger. It is usually a child’s
      response to authority, when they can’t get their own way. In adults, it
      often happens for the same reason, perhaps when someone has lost a power
      struggle. Sulking is essentially a loser’s response to the more powerful
      winner.</p>
    <p>‘It achieves just what we have been talking about. It reduces the
      force of anger by releasing it gradually at a very low level of
      intensity. And this of course reduces the aggression.’</p>
    <p>There was a long silence as they both thought about this. Toad was
      beginning to realise that more and more of his behaviour originated from
      his Adapted Child. Heron was trying to recognise how far Toad was
      understanding these issues, and asking himself whether he, the Heron,
      was doing too much of the talking.</p>
    <p>Eventually Toad asked, ‘Are there many other ways in which a child
      learns to be angry?’</p>
    <p>‘I’m sure there are hundreds,’ Heron replied. ‘When you think about
      it, each of us must adapt to the particular circumstances of our
      childhood. It is like a great mosaic of behaviour, with all the
      associated feelings and emotions.’</p>
    <p>‘So can I ask you how <span class="italic">you</span> analyse them?’
      Toad asked.</p>
    <p>‘Certainly,’ answered Heron. ‘Let me draw you a diagram.’</p>
    <p>And this is what he drew:</p>
    <p><img src="./images/00001.jpg" class="calibre_4" /></p>
    <p>Then he continued, ‘Of course the point is—and I know you are
      beginning to realise this, Toad—that all these behavioural strategies
      are, in effect, defence mechanisms developed in our childhood to protect
      us from the dangers we perceived then, real or imaginary.</p>
    <p>When we see adults sulking and throwing tantrums and moping about and
      saying they are bored, we may wonder if their behaviour is appropriate
      or whether they are compelled, yet again, to act out their
      childhood.’</p>
    <p>‘Well, and what’s so wrong with that?’ asked Toad petulantly, who
      felt that he was being ‘got at’ by Heron. ‘We can all be a bit childish
      at times, can’t we?’</p>
    <p>‘There’s nothing “wrong” about it in any moral sense,’ answered
      Heron. ‘Analysis is not judgemental. But these kinds of behaviours have
      two consequences, both negative. The first is that they invite ridicule.
      Seeing a grown person having a tantrum or sulking can be very amusing,
      as well as embarrassing. But, more significantly, these behaviours
      demonstrate and reveal the loser.’</p>
    <p>‘That makes me feel very bad,’ said Toad. ‘We do all this work and
      the result is that I feel I have been stupid for a lot of my life. What
      can I do, Heron? When am I going to learn how to be grown up?’</p>
    <p>‘How about at our next meeting?’ said Heron, and with a smile he
      showed Toad to the door.</p>
    <p><span class="bold">8 </span></p>
    <p><span class="bold">A surprise visit from Mr Badger</span></p>
    <p>It was about teatime and Toad was watching cricket on the television.
      He had always enjoyed the game and, although he no longer played, he was
      the president of the village team and took a keen interest in all the
      county matches. He was just thinking about making himself some tea when
      the front doorbell rang.</p>
    <p>There were no longer any servants at Toad Hall. A woman came in to
      clean twice a week and a number of the larger rooms were permanently
      shut. Toad lived mainly in the kitchen, which was warm and snug, and he
      had the television in the small breakfast-room which adjoined it, which
      had lovely views over the gardens and down to the river. He kept the
      front door closed and always used the back entrance.</p>
    <p>So when the bell rang he got up quickly and walked down the long,
      dark corridor, pulled back the bolts, unfastened the chains and finally
      opened the large, iron-studded door.</p>
    <p>There, to his great surprise, stood Badger!</p>
    <p>‘Good afternoon, Toad,’ he said briskly and walked through the
      doorway and strode purposefully down the hall.</p>
    <p>Toad, initially speechless, shut the front door as best he could and
      scurried after him, apologising for the state of the house and saying,
      ‘Why didn’t you let me know you were coming?’ and generally blabbering
      on and feeling a complete fool.</p>
    <p>Badger, who had been a great friend of his father and knew Toad Hall
      well, was about to open the doors of the drawing-room. But Toad got
      there first. ‘I don’t use this room much nowadays. Come on down here.’
      The fact of the matter was that Toad hadn’t used the drawing-room in
      years. It was dusty and musty and cobwebs festooned the curtains.</p>
    <p>Toad took Badger into the breakfast-room and, having picked the
      newspaper off the floor and shoved his slippers under the table, offered
      Badger a seat. He hovered about feeling very anxious and ill at
      ease.</p>
    <p>‘Can I get you anything, Badger?’ he asked. ‘A cup of tea? A slice of
      cake?’</p>
    <p>‘No, thank you,’ Badger answered. ‘I never eat between meals. And
      Toad, do you think you could turn that television off? I can’t hear
      myself think.’ Then he added, ‘It’s a bit early to be watching the box,
      isn’t it? I never put it on before six. Just for the news. There’s never
      anything worth watching.’ Toad immediately switched off the offending
      set.</p>
    <p>He perched himself on the edge of a chair and tried to make
      conversation. ‘It’s beginning to get warmer, don’t you think? Some of
      the crocuses are out.’</p>
    <p>‘Only crocuses?’ asked Badger in surprise. ‘You should see my
      daffodils. Masses of them!’</p>
    <p>Poor Toad, his daffodils were only just emerging. He was filled with
      shame for being such a poor gardener.</p>
    <p>‘But you do go on, Toad,’ said Badger sternly. ‘It would be nice if
      you could listen for a change.’</p>
    <p>‘Sorry,’ said Toad automatically. He sat down meekly and waited for
      Badger to continue.</p>
    <p>‘Now look here, Toad,’ he began, ‘the reason I am here is because
      there is something that must be discussed. I know that you have not been
      yourself lately and have been out of circulation. But the rest of the
      world moves on, you know. Things can’t stop just because you are not
      feeling well.’</p>
    <p>‘No, of course not,’ said Toad. ‘Silly of me to think so.’</p>
    <p>‘So’, continued Badger, ‘I am concerned that something should be
      done. I am sure it is what your father would have wished.’</p>
    <p>‘Oh, certainly,’ Toad murmured. ‘I’ sure he would.’ But he didn’t
      have a clue what Badger was talking about.</p>
    <p>‘You do know to what I am referring, don’t you, Toad?’</p>
    <p>‘Well, not exactly,’ answered Toad. ‘Could you spell it out for me a
      little?’</p>
    <p>‘Surely it’s obvious. It’s about you being a governor of the village
      school.’</p>
    <p>‘Yes, I am,’ said Toad. ‘I haven’t attended many meetings recently
      because…’ He paused. ‘Because I have been unwell. But I mean to start
      going again soon.’</p>
    <p>The village school was small with only two classes, but it had
      educated several generations of villagers. Now that people were moving
      away into the nearby town, the number of pupils was falling and there
      was even some talk of closing it down. Toad, however was committed to
      its continuation and had spent many hours on the committee, trying to
      raise funds and maintain standards.</p>
    <p>‘Well, that’s just it,’ said Badger. ‘Everyone knows that you haven’t
      been to the meetings recently and there are some big issues coming
      up.’</p>
    <p>‘Yes I know,’ said Toad, ‘and I mean to go to the next one.’ He had
      in fact just received the minutes of the last meeting and was about to
      write to the vicar, who was the chairman, to tell him that he would
      definitely be attending.</p>
    <p>‘But you probably won’t be well enough by then, will you?’ asked
      Badger. ‘You’re still looking a bit peaky. What does that counselling
      fellow say? Depression, wasn’t it? Funny, I don’t think I have ever been
      depressed in my life. Too much to do, I suppose. No time to sit and
      brood.’</p>
    <p>Toad felt that Badger was looking at him accusingly. He started to
      feel angry, but this quickly changed to feeling miserable. He felt that
      Badger thought he was malingering, and he wished he could pull himself
      together and be more like him.</p>
    <p>‘So I’ve had a word with the vicar,’ Badger continued, ‘and he agrees
      with me. There’s no need to worry yourself.’</p>
    <p>‘What has he agreed to?’ asked Toad, apprehensively.</p>
    <p>‘Why, to me taking over your place as a governor. Not that I really
      have the time,’</p>
    <p>Badger said sternly, looking at Toad over his half-moon glasses.
      ‘What with the Bench and the District Council, there aren’t enough hours
      in the day. But one must do what one can.’</p>
    <p>‘But I am still on the committee,’ said Toad, feeling a bit stronger.
      ‘You know I am.’</p>
    <p>‘Yes, but if you resign for health reasons’, answered Badger, ‘there
      need be no election and the vicar said that he would co-opt me on to the
      committee. So I thought, Toad, that you could write your resignation
      letter now and I will take it straight over to the vicar. Save you the
      trouble of posting it’</p>
    <p>Toad was in a turmoil. He was feeling so angry, he would have liked
      to punch Badger on the nose. How dare he! How dare he go to the vicar
      behind his back and try to get him removed from the school council! What
      a nerve! He really enjoyed being on the school committee. He felt that
      he had something to offer and he always enjoyed organising the school’s
      summer fête on the lawns of Toad Hall.</p>
    <p>But then, he thought, Badger might be right after all. Perhaps he
      ought to resign and let him take over. He would certainly bring
      tremendous energy to the task. But, thought Toad, he would bring other
      things as well. He would bring his temper and his intolerance and his
      ability to get people’s backs up. I suppose that’s the price you have to
      pay for Badger, he thought perceptively. But is it too high?</p>
    <p>‘Well, Toad, are you going to write it?’ asked Badger
      impatiently.</p>
    <p>Toad didn’t know what to do. Badger seemed so strong and confident
      and he felt so small and uncertain.</p>
    <p>‘Perhaps I need a day or two to think it over,’ he said in a small
      voice. ‘After all, I have been a governor for some time and I think I
      would miss it’</p>
    <p>‘Yes, Toad, you probably would for a few days. But we must not be
      sentimental.</p>
    <p>Remember, it’s what’s good for the school! We must not let our
      personal feelings get in the way of that’</p>
    <p>‘Oh no, of course not, Badger,’ answered Toad. ‘I hope I’m not being
      selfish,’</p>
    <p>‘I’ll tell you what,’ said Badger, ‘why don’t you have a think about
      it and telephone me later this evening? That will give me time to
      contact the vicar and fix everything up.’</p>
    <p>‘I think,’ said Toad, summoning up all his courage, ‘I think that I
      shall need longer than that. I will phone you tomorrow evening.’ Toad
      remembered that he was going for a counselling session next morning and
      he needed Heron’s help.</p>
    <p>‘Very well,’ answered Badger. ‘You were always indecisive, Toad. I
      didn’t get where I am today by being indecisive! See a problem, come up
      with a solution, make a decision.</p>
    <p>That’s how I deal with things.’ He rose from his seat.</p>
    <p>‘Don’t bother to see me out, Toad. I can find my own way. And Toad,’
      he added, ‘I should get to bed early if I were you. You’re looking
      peaky. You should take more care of yourself. Look after Number One,
      that’s what I always say’ And with that, he was gone.</p>
    <p>Toad had just enough strength to pour himself a stiff brandy and soda
      before he collapsed on to the settee.</p>
    <p><span class="bold">9 </span></p>
    <p><span class="bold">After Badger’s visit</span></p>
    <p>Toad could hardly wait until the next day, when it would be his
      counselling session. He was hopping mad. (Appropriate for a toad, he
      thought, in a lighter moment.)</p>
    <p>‘Just wait until I tell Heron,’ he said to himself. ‘He’ll never
      believe it! He won’t credit it that Badger came to my house, uninvited,
      and tried to get me to give up my school governorship. Badger had better
      not show his face here again in a hurry or it will be the worse for him!
      I’ll show him!’</p>
    <p>However, it must be understood that this anger and frenzied activity
      were going on <span class="italic">within</span> Toad. Such feelings and
      such anger! But there were no external signs by which the outside world
      would have known just how strongly he was feeling.</p>
    <p>By the evening his anger had subsided and he was once again in his
      usual unhappy state of mind, feeling sad and miserable. ‘Badger’s right
      after all,’ he thought. ‘He would make a much better governor than me.
      He’s got such drive and determination. They probably only made me a
      governor because I live here at the Hall and they can use the garden for
      their summer fête. That night, he slept badly and woke early.</p>
    <p>When he went to the Heronry on the following day, he was feeling low
      and miserable.</p>
    <p>Heron ushered him in and said, ‘Morning Toad, and how are you
      feeling?’</p>
    <p>‘Bloody awful,’ answered Toad, who did not usually use bad language
      but felt this last trace of anger blow over him like the tail end of a
      hurricane.</p>
    <p>‘Why don’t you tell me about it?’ asked Heron.</p>
    <p>And so Toad told him the sorry tale of Badger’s visit and how he had
      wanted Toad to resign from the school committee.</p>
    <p>‘So how did this make you feel?’ asked Heron.</p>
    <p>‘Terrible,’ answered Toad. ‘I don’t seem to be of much value to
      myself or to others. I’ve just about definitely decided to resign and
      send my letter to the vicar. It will be best for everyone.’</p>
    <p>Heron remained silent for some considerable time. It was not that he
      didn’t understand Toad’s situation. He understood it only too well. But
      he was uncertain which path of learning to pursue. Eventually he
      spoke.</p>
    <p>‘Toad, I have to congratulate you. You play a very good game.’</p>
    <p>Toad looked up, bemused. ‘Game? What game? I’m not playing a
      game.’</p>
    <p>‘I suggest that you are,’ answered Heron. ‘You play a very good game
      of PLOM.’</p>
    <p>‘Plom? What on earth is that?’ asked Toad.</p>
    <p>‘PLOM stands for “Poor Little Old Me” and you win it every time. Or
      lose. It all depends on your point of view.’</p>
    <p>‘I really don’t understand what you are talking about,’ said Toad
      peevishly. ‘I am not playing a game. I’ve told you in all honesty about
      a very unpleasant situation which has befallen me and you say I am
      playing a game with you?’ Toad looked at Heron reproachfully.</p>
    <p>‘“Honesty” is an interesting word,’ said Heron.</p>
    <p>‘Are you saying that I’m dishonest?’ said Toad, beginning to feel
      angry. After all, his family motto was ‘Guard Thine Honour’.</p>
    <p>‘Yes, I think I am,’ said Heron surprisingly, ‘but not in the usual
      sense of the word. I think you can be dishonest with your <span class="italic">self</span>. Why do you keep
      getting
      into situations
      where you end up looking stupid and someone gets the upper hand and you
      feel like a poor little child again? Is it just wretched bad luck, or do
      you in some way collude in the process?’</p>
    <p>‘What does “collude” mean?’ asked Toad.</p>
    <p>‘It means a secret agreement. I use “collude” to mean that you
      secretly or unknowingly cooperate with others to create your own
      unhappiness. And that’s why psychological games are played. And the
      losing is in the winning,’ said Heron enigmatically.</p>
    <p>‘Now look here, Heron,’ said Toad strongly as he tried to resist
      these ideas, ‘there was no “collusion” as you call it. I never knew
      Badger was going to call. Or ask me to resign. And I want to remain a
      governor. It all came out of the blue. So how could I have cooperated
      with him, secretly or otherwise?’ Toad was clearly very upset.</p>
    <p>Then Heron made what was the closest to an apology Toad had ever
      heard from him.</p>
    <p>‘I’m sorry, Toad,’ he said. ‘I obviously have not made my point well
      or else you are not yet ready to explore this particular idea. You feel
      that I am accusing you and nothing could be further from my mind. So may
      we leave that point and come back to it later?’</p>
    <p>‘If you say so,’ answered Toad rather huffily. ‘But I shall want to
      hear more about these so-called games. I take it that there are others
      you think I play?’</p>
    <p>‘Yes, I think there probably are,’ replied Heron. ‘But if you are
      feeling so defensive, you will not be able to analyse them now. I think
      we should move on.’</p>
    <p>There was a pause, as Toad realised that he was feeling extremely
      strongly about the things Heron had just been saying. Yet he wasn’t sure
      why.</p>
    <p>‘Alright,’ said Toad, ‘but you may be right. I felt very hot under
      the collar when you said that about colluding and wanting to make myself
      unhappy. It seems so stupid that I should try to make myself
      miserable.’</p>
    <p>‘Look, Toad,’ said Heron, ‘some of the ideas which arise in this work
      can initially seem silly or illogical or even frightening. And those
      ideas that are most likely to provide the deepest personal insights are
      those most likely to be strongly resisted.’</p>
    <p>‘Why is that?’ asked Toad.</p>
    <p>‘Because they threaten our equilibrium the most,’ answered Heron.
      ‘They are the ideas that are most likely to lead to personal change at a
      deep level. And that is often painful, as I think you are discovering.
      When we look at ourselves, we do not always like what we see. To move
      from where we are now to where we would like to be must inevitably
      involve changes in our behaviour and our attitudes. To achieve this
      requires hard work, courage and determination. So you can see, Toad, why
      you might resist opening a door that could lead on to such a difficult
      path.’</p>
    <p>‘But it could also lead to great understanding,’ said Toad
      quietly.</p>
    <p>‘Of course,’ said Heron, ‘and that is why we are working together,
      travelling on the same path.’ There was a long pause as they sat
      together in a companionable silence.</p>
    <p>‘Shall we move on now?’ asked Heron eventually. ‘You had been telling
      me about Badger’s visit and how he made you feel. So let me ask you this
      question. What kind of state do you think he was in when he called on
      you?’</p>
    <p>‘He certainly was not in the Child Ego State, that’s for sure,’ said
      Toad. ‘It’s hard to believe that he was ever little. He always reminds
      me of my father.’</p>
    <p>‘Well done, Toad. I believe that you are exactly right. In fact,
      Badger was in the Parent Ego State.’</p>
    <p>‘And what exactly is that?’ Toad asked.</p>
    <p>‘When we are in the Parent State, we behave like our parents.
      Remember, they were the first people we ever experienced. So their
      influence on us is immeasurable. The Parent State contains all the
      values and morals we have learnt from them since birth. It contains our
      standards for living and enables us to say what we believe to be good or
      bad, right or wrong. These values originated from our parents, who were
      the main influence on our behaviour. Their words and actions moulded our
      early years and inevitably influence the rest of our lives.’</p>
    <p>‘So do you think that Badger’s parents would have been stern
      moralists and that is why he behaves as he does?’ asked Toad.</p>
    <p>‘It’s very likely,’ answered Heron, ‘but remember this, Toad. We are
      never simply a clone of our parents. Whilst they have enormous influence
      on us, our own personal unique-ness ensures that we are not just copies
      of our mothers or fathers, but individuals in our own right.</p>
    <p>‘So’, he continued, ‘what other behaviour would you expect to see in
      someone who is in their Parent Ego State?’</p>
    <p>‘The way they look, do you think?’ asked Toad. ‘I’m thinking of my
      own father. He could look very stern and displeased at times.’</p>
    <p>‘Right,’ said Heron, ‘and how did he sound?’</p>
    <p>‘Angry. He could either be quiet and cold and icy, or he could be
      loud and frightening.</p>
    <p>I’m not sure which frightened me most.’</p>
    <p>‘And can you think of other examples of people you have met who were
      in their Parent?’ Heron asked.</p>
    <p>Toad thought for a bit. ‘Yes, I have come across other people like
      that. Certainly some of the masters at my school,’ He paused. ‘When you
      start to think about it, you come across examples of it all the time.
      For instance, I went to the cricket ground the other day to see how the
      preparations were going for the Saturday match. Our groundsman, who’s a
      surly old so-and-so, was painting the white lines on the crease. I went
      up to him for a chat and asked him how he was getting on. He looked me
      in the eye and said, “I was doing alright until you came along!” I felt
      very uncomfortable.’</p>
    <p>Heron smiled. ‘That seems like a very good example. Any others?’</p>
    <p>‘Yes, there is one that comes to mind,’ Toad replied. ‘I can still
      feel angry when I think about it. I went to the dry-cleaners the other
      day to take a number of my bow-ties to be cleaned. They had got rather
      grubby, soup stains, that sort of thing. The lady behind the counter
      took one look at them and said, “You don’t want dry-cleaning. You want a
      bib!”</p>
    <p>The cheek of the woman.’</p>
    <p>Heron smiled. ‘Once again,’ he said, ‘I think you are on to something
      important. Let’s write it up.’ He went to the flip-chart and wrote the
      heading ‘The Parent Ego State’.</p>
    <p>Underneath he drew a circle and divided it in half with a vertical
      line. In the right half he wrote ‘Critical Parent’.</p>
    <p><img src="./images/00002.jpg" class="calibre_5" /></p>
    <p>‘Now Toad,’ he said, ‘what words would you use to describe someone in
      their Critical Parent State?’</p>
    <p>‘Well, I think we have mentioned them already,’ Toad replied and he
      took the crayon and wrote ‘Judgemental’, ‘Angry’, ‘Severe’. ‘I suppose
      there are lots of others?’ he said.</p>
    <p>‘I’m sure there are,’ answered Heron, ‘but I think these encapsulate
      the Critical Parent.’</p>
    <p>Toad sat down and looked at the words which he had written. After a
      while he said,</p>
    <p>‘Heron, there’s something I don’t quite understand.’</p>
    <p>‘Can you put it into a question?’ asked Heron. That usually takes the
      learning forward.’</p>
    <p>‘I’m not sure that I can, initially,’ Toad replied. ‘You see, what
      you have just told me about this Parent Ego State has really opened my
      eyes. For instance, it helps explain Badger’s behaviour so well. When he
      came round to my house, almost everything he said was critical or
      judgemental. No wonder that he reminds me so much of my father! Knowing
      what I know now, I can almost predict what Badger will say when we next
      meet. And how he will behave.’</p>
    <p>‘Excellent,’ said Heron. ‘You are clearly developing your emotional
      intelligence.’</p>
    <p>‘I am?’ asked Toad in surprise.</p>
    <p>‘Certainly,’ said Heron. ‘Intelligence is not just a matter of IQ. We
      need EQ as well.’</p>
    <p>‘Well,’ said Toad, ‘I don’t feel very intelligent about my next
      question. Which is this.</p>
    <p>Where’s <span class="italic">my</span> Critical Parent? You said that
      everyone has got one and it derives from what our parents said to us and
      how they treated us when we were little. It certainly helps to explain
      the way Badger, and other people, behave. So what about me? Where’s
      mine? I honestly don’t think I’ve got one. I hardly ever get angry.
      That’s really true, Heron. I don’t get angry with people. I don’t tell
      people off. I don’t shout at them or criticise them. In fact, it’s
      usually the opposite. I see the best in them and encourage them. It
      makes me a sound a bit weak, I know, but that’s how I am.’</p>
    <p>There was a long pause before Heron spoke. ‘Toad, are you ready for
      some more personal learning? I mean learning at a deep level?’</p>
    <p>Toad looked steadily at Heron. ‘Yes I am,’ he said, ‘but it hurts
      sometimes, you know. I am getting many new insights, but I don’t always
      like what I discover.’</p>
    <p>‘I know, I know,’ said Heron sympathetically, ‘but remember what they
      say, “No gain without pain”.’</p>
    <p>‘I find that kind of saying particularly annoying,’ answered Toad
      with some spirit. ‘You usually find it written on calendars with
      pictures of seagulls and rose-coloured clouds.</p>
    <p>Trite. Or tripe.’</p>
    <p>‘Be that as it may,’ answered Heron, in what Toad thought was a
      slightly pompous manner, ‘let us try to find the answer to the problem
      you have posed. Perhaps we can clarify it by writing it down.’ He went
      to the flip-chart, found a fresh page and wrote the following:</p>
    <p>Does Toad have a Parent Ego State?</p>
    <p>Then he said, ‘Now let’s write down some of the parameters of the
      problem.’ And he wrote:</p>
    <p>1 Everyone has a Parent Ego State.</p>
    <p>2 There seems no evidence that Toad has one.</p>
    <p>Then he turned to Toad and said, ‘So what should be our next
      question?’</p>
    <p>‘Clearly, the next question must be’, answered Toad, ‘why haven’t I
      got one?’</p>
    <p>‘I think there is a more logical question than that,’ said Heron.</p>
    <p>‘What is that?’ asked Toad.</p>
    <p>‘We could ask, “How does it operate?”’</p>
    <p>Toad thought for a moment. Eventually he said, ‘I don’t understand. I
      thought you agreed with me that I don’t have a Parent State. So how can
      it operate?’</p>
    <p>‘I don’t agree that you don’t have one. In fact,’ said Heron, ‘I
      believe you have a very powerful one. The question is, “how does it
      work?” It’s clear that it operates in a very different way to
      Badger’s.’</p>
    <p>‘You’ve got me really confused,’ said Toad. ‘I don’t know where I
      am.’</p>
    <p>‘I think confusion is often the first stage in the learning process,’
      said Heron. ‘It happens when fixed boundaries begin to unfreeze. You
      start to be confronted with new data that challenge existing beliefs and
      behaviour. It can be the beginning of creativity, the anxiety that
      drives the process of change.’</p>
    <p>Toad looked unconvinced by Heron’s explanation. ‘It don’t feel like
      that,’ he said grumpily and ungrammatically.</p>
    <p>‘So let’s try thinking about this problem in a different way,’ said
      Heron. ‘Let’s think of this Parent State as more like a judge, who is
      seeking to accuse someone, find them guilty and then, quite logically,
      punish them. Does that make sense to you, Toad?’</p>
    <p>‘It certainly does,’ he said.</p>
    <p>‘Do you think that Badger behaved like a judge yesterday?’</p>
    <p>‘Oh, definitely,’ said Toad. ‘That’s just how he was and I felt like
      the prisoner at the bar.</p>
    <p>I can speak about this from experience, you know. It’s terrible to be
      found guilty. But it’s even worse to <span class="italic">feel</span>
      guilty!’</p>
    <p>‘So who do <span class="italic">you</span> judge, Toad?’</p>
    <p>‘That’s just the point,’ said Toad irritably. ‘I don’t. I’m not that
      kind of person.’</p>
    <p>‘Toad,’ said Heron, ‘may I invite you to think again and ask yourself
      the question: who do you judge?’</p>
    <p>There was a long, long silence. Then Toad said in a small voice, ‘I
      think I see what you are getting at. Do you mean that I judge myself?’
      Heron sat quietly and said nothing.</p>
    <p>After some time, Toad spoke. ‘Then I suppose I find myself guilty and
      condemn myself.</p>
    <p>Is that it?’</p>
    <p>‘There can be no stronger criticism than self-criticism. And no
      harsher judge than ourselves,’ answered Heron.</p>
    <p>‘Oh dear,’ said Toad. ‘Do you mean we can punish ourselves?’</p>
    <p>‘Severely,’ said Heron, ‘including torture and, in extreme cases,
      execution. But the problem is that, even if the sentence is light, it
      can be imposed for life.’</p>
    <p>‘So what can I do?’ asked Toad. ‘I’ve got a lot of life in front of
      me. I don’t want to keep punishing myself, if that is what I do. I’d
      like a bit of happiness. What can I do, Heron?</p>
    <p>Can you help me?’</p>
    <p>‘It may sound a little stark, Toad, but it is you and only you who
      can help yourself. There are lots of questions that you should consider.
      For instance, can you stop judging yourself?</p>
    <p>Can you be kinder to yourself? And perhaps the most important
      question of them all. Can you start to love yourself?’</p>
    <p>Toad sat still, completely motionless. After a while Heron said, ‘Are
      you alright Toad?</p>
    <p>It’s time to go.’</p>
    <p><span id="index_split_001.html"></span></p>
    <p>‘Yes,’ he replied, ‘I’m alright. But you’ve given me so much to think
      about, my mind’s buzzing. I feel quite light-headed.’</p>
    <p>‘So be careful going home,’ said Heron, ‘and I will see you next
      week.’ Then he added, ‘Toad, do look after yourself.’ And Toad walked
      slowly down the path and through the gate.</p>
    <p><span class="bold">10 </span></p>
    <p><span class="bold">Lunch at Rat’s house</span></p>
    <p>The last session with Heron left Toad feeling rather desolate. He
      understood the concept of the Critical Parent when it was applied to
      other people, Badger especially. But when he applied it to himself, the
      thought that he was criticising and even punishing himself was
      unnerving.</p>
    <p>Yet at the same time, he was aware that there were changes happening
      to him. Deep within himself, he was feeling stronger. He found that he
      was able to consider these very emotional and threatening ideas more
      rationally. He was less emotional when he viewed himself objectively,
      and this enabled him to understand himself better and to learn. Yet,
      intellectually, he felt that there was still a piece of the puzzle
      missing.</p>
    <p>He understood just how much of the time he was in his Adapted Child
      State. And it was beginning to dawn on him that he had the ability, or
      even the need, to criticise and punish himself in the same way his
      parents had done when he was little. He remembered something that Heron
      had said about collusion, ‘a secret or unknowing cooperation with
      others’. Could you collude with yourself to condemn yourself? And
      without even knowing you were doing it, even unconsciously?</p>
    <p>These were difficult ideas for Toad to handle, especially when they
      involved his very self. They flitted through his mind like shadows, and
      seemed equally impossible to capture and examine. What was the way
      forward? Heron kept on about understanding and learning, but where was
      it all leading? For the first time since he started to work with the
      Heron, he wondered how much longer the counselling would last.</p>
    <p>But at the same time, Toad was beginning to feel more energetic. One
      morning, he found himself walking down the garden path that led to the
      dry boat-house where a number of racing skiffs were kept. He examined
      them and found one that appeared to be in good condition. He carried it
      to the water’s edge, fetched the oars, carefully climbed in and started
      gently to paddle the boat upstream. He didn’t do at all badly. He had
      always rolled and splashed a good deal but this time he consciously
      restrained himself and after a while returned. When he got out, he was
      panting and his back was aching but he felt good. ‘I really enjoyed
      that,’ he said to himself.</p>
    <p>‘And that deserves a beer!’ So he went and had one.</p>
    <p>Later that week, he received an invitation to lunch with Rat and
      Mole. Since the beginning of his depression, they had left him on his
      own. This was for a number of reasons. The first was that they were a
      little embarrassed by Toad’s initial behaviour and were uncertain how to
      cope with it. And, second, like all sick or wounded animals, Toad had
      simply wanted to crawl away and be left on his own and he had clearly
      signalled this.</p>
    <p>But now things were different. For a start, the weather was
      improving. The sun was getting warmer every day and, up and down the
      river bank, boats were being painted and varnished ready for summer.
      Word had got around that Toad was on the water again and not looking too
      bad. But more than all of that, Rat and Mole had missed him. So they
      invited him to lunch.</p>
    <p>As Toad walked along the river bank to Rat’s house, he felt very
      fragile. It was as if the suit of armour he usually wore was removed.
      His senses, especially his sight, seemed to be particularly acute. The
      colours of the grass and the trees were unusually vibrant and he thought
      that never before had he realised there were so many different shades of
      green.</p>
    <p>He felt in touch with things and alert to his surroundings. As he
      walked, he found that he was checking over his feelings in much the same
      way as a pilot checks his instruments before take-off. Although he was
      slightly apprehensive about meeting his friends again, on the whole he
      was feeling good. If Heron asked me where I was now on his Feelings
      Thermometer, he thought, I would say eight.</p>
    <p>When he arrived, his friends gave him an extremely warm welcome. He
      was given the best chair by the fire (it was still chilly indoors), and
      Mole shoved cushions all around him to ensure that he was
      comfortable.</p>
    <p>‘Oh Toad, it’s so good to see you,’ said Mole. ‘We’ve been so worried
      about you.’</p>
    <p>‘Yes, we have,’ said Rat gruffly. He couldn’t show his feelings quite
      as easily as his friend. ‘We certainly have missed you. Sherry?’</p>
    <p>Toad was offered a small glass of dry sherry and tried to sip it
      slowly. He could never understand how anyone could make these tiny
      glasses last so long. He was essentially a brandy-and-soda man and, when
      he drank sherry at home, he tended to use a wine-glass.</p>
    <p>‘How are you chaps?’ he asked. ‘You’re both looking well. Anything
      much happening on the river bank? Have I missed much?’</p>
    <p>‘No, not much,’ answered Mole. ‘You know how it is in the winter.
      Things can go very quiet and this year it was too cold to go out much.’
      Mole paused. ‘But do you notice anything, Toady? I’ve spent a lot of
      time decorating this room. Do you like the wallpaper?</p>
    <p>It’s a William Morris design called “Willow Boughs”.’ Toad looked
      around and realised that the room was in fact looking very different
      from when he had last seen it. The walls were papered with a swirling
      pattern of thin brown willow branches laden with green and yellow
      leaves. Mole had white-washed the ceiling and the whole room, with its
      old oak furniture and glowing fireplace, had an air of solid comfort and
      sensible values.</p>
    <p>‘Excellent,’ said Toad. ‘How well you’ve done it, Mole. I only wish
      Toad Hall looked half as smart,’ and he started to feel a bit
      dejected.</p>
    <p>‘Now then,’ interrupted Rat, ‘how about some lunch? Nothing fancy
      here you know. We live quite plainly.’</p>
    <p>Mole was about to add, ‘Not like you do at Toad Hall,’ but he saw how
      Toad was feeling and kept quiet.</p>
    <p>The lunch was plain but good. Rat had made a thick onion soup with
      croutons. Then there was a Stilton and plenty of fresh crusty bread and
      butter and pickles. They finished their meal with a plate of the best
      kind of apples, Cox’s Orange Pippins, and all of this was served with a
      frothy jug of beer.</p>
    <p>Soon tongues were loosened and Toad began to feel at ease, almost
      like his old self. He found himself laughing at one of Rat’s anecdotes
      and responding with one of his own. Then Mole asked if he had seen
      Badger lately. ‘We haven’t seen him for ages.’</p>
    <p>‘Well, strangely enough, he called on me only the other day,’ replied
      Toad.</p>
    <p>‘Called on you!’ exclaimed Rat. ‘Good heavens. He must think the
      world of you, Toad.</p>
    <p>I’ve never known Badger to call on anyone before.’</p>
    <p>‘Well, it wasn’t quite like that,’ said Toad, and he started to tell
      them about Badger’s visit and how he had wanted him to resign his school
      governorship so that he could take it over.</p>
    <p>‘Well I’m blowed!’ said Mole when Toad had finished the story. ‘What
      a nerve! Badger’s got many good points and he’s very energetic. But he
      can be very arrogant. What a nerve!’</p>
    <p>‘Yes,’ agreed Rat, ‘but you haven’t told us what you finally decided
      to do.’</p>
    <p>‘Haven’t I?’, asked Toad. ‘Well, I thought about it for a long time.
      I even discussed it with Heron.’</p>
    <p>‘Is that your counsellor?’ interrupted Mole. ‘How’s that going?’</p>
    <p>‘Oh, not too bad,’ said Toad. Then he continued, ‘I had finally
      decided to resign. I just felt I couldn’t go against Badger any longer.
      He’s so strong and so sure of himself. But then I thought, Why should I?
      Why should I have to agree with him? Why shouldn’t I do what I want to
      do? To be honest, I felt quite angry with him.’</p>
    <p>‘So did you go to see Badger and tell him?’ asked Mole with great
      interest.</p>
    <p>‘No, I decided not to,’ said Toad. ‘I felt that if I saw him I would
      be bound to lose. Rather childish really, I admit, but true. So I wrote
      him a note instead, saying that on further consideration I would not
      resign because I was feeling a lot better. If he felt like it, he could
      put his name forward in September when I come up for re-election and we
      will see what happens then.’</p>
    <p>‘Well done,’ said Rat warmly. ‘I think, given the circumstances, you
      handled that extremely well.’</p>
    <p>‘Yes, you certainly did,’ agreed the Mole. ‘I’d say that you
      won.’</p>
    <p>‘Do you really think so?’ asked Toad, feeling strangely pleased. ‘I
      felt worn out by the end of it. I felt I had been fighting a battle
      which was not of my choosing. Anyway, it’s over and done with now… I
      hope,’ he added <span class="italic">sotto voce</span>.</p>
    <p>After some more chat, Toad said that he must be getting back. Rat and
      Mole said they would go with him as they needed the exercise. So the
      three companions walked back to Toad Hall. There Toad thanked them for
      lunch and they agreed to meet up again soon.</p>
    <p>‘Perhaps a rubber of bridge?’ suggested Rat, who played a sound hand
      and had taught Mole the basics of the game.</p>
    <p>‘We would need a fourth,’ said Mole.</p>
    <p>‘Not Badger,’ said Toad strongly.</p>
    <p>‘No, I was thinking of Otter,’ answered Rat. ‘Anyway, we’ll leave it
      for now and get in touch. ‘Bye.’ And off they went.</p>
    <p>As they were walking home, Mole said to Rat, ‘Well, what do you
      think?’</p>
    <p>‘About what?’ asked Rat, whose mind was on other things.</p>
    <p>‘About Toad, of course. Don’t you think he’s changed?’</p>
    <p>‘Yes I do,’ said the Rat. ‘But it’s hard to put your finger on
      it.’</p>
    <p>‘He listened more,’ answered Mole. ‘That’s what it was. He listened
      and, what’s more, he seemed genuinely interested in what we had to say.
      Usually you can hardly finish a sentence before he comes crashing in. If
      I’m honest, he seemed nicer. And quieter. Not so tiring.’</p>
    <p>‘Yes, I know what you mean,’ agreed Rat. ‘He used to be a bit of an
      ass. Always boasting and full of himself. But I suppose his breakdown
      (this had become the accepted way to describe Toad’s situation) has
      knocked the stuffing out of him. But I was surprised to hear his story
      about Badger. Toad would never have stood up to him in the past. What a
      difference!’</p>
    <p>‘Yes, I agree,’ said Mole. ‘But’, he added wistfully, ‘I think Toad
      has lost his sparkle.’</p>
    <p><span class="bold">11 </span></p>
    <p><span class="bold">Toad meets the Adult</span></p>
    <p>‘So’, said the Heron at their next counselling session, ‘how are you
      feeling today?’ Toad not only expected this question but was in fact
      eager to answer it.</p>
    <p>‘I’m feeling much better,’ he said. ‘I am certainly happier in myself
      and I have much more energy’ He told the Heron about starting to row
      again and how he had been to lunch with his two friends.</p>
    <p>‘That’s excellent,’ replied Heron, ‘but Toad, have you thought why
      these changes have come about?’</p>
    <p>‘I’m not sure,’ he replied, after a long pause. ‘It’s very hard to
      understand what’s going on inside your own head. But I certainly feel
      stronger. It’s difficult to explain. There are still times when I get
      those familiar feelings of sadness and worthlessness. They are still
      inside me somewhere, but they no longer take centre stage. I seem to be
      able to push them to one side, and I don’t feel so dominated by
      them.’</p>
    <p>‘I am delighted to hear that,’ said the Heron. ‘You are clearly
      developing your self-insight and emotional intelligence. But let me ask
      you this.’ He looked hard at Toad. ‘What ego state were you just in when
      you answered me then?’</p>
    <p>Toad thought. ‘Well,’ he said, I certainly was not in my Parent Ego
      State. And I know that I wasn’t in my Child.’ He paused. ‘Recently I’ve
      been thinking that there ought to be another ego state, in which you are
      neither behaving like your parents nor feeling like a child. One in
      which you are more grown up. More like yourself at the present moment,
      if that makes sense.’</p>
    <p>‘It certainly does,’ said Heron enthusiastically. ‘There <span class="italic">is</span> such a state. And you
      have
      discovered this for
      yourself. Well done!’</p>
    <p>‘Have I?’ asked Toad in some surprise. ‘What is it called? The
      Grown-up State?’</p>
    <p>‘Not quite,’ said Heron. ‘It’s called the Adult and it completes the
      trinity of the ego states. The three of them are Parent, Adult and Child
      and these three states describe the structure of your personality. We
      can draw this very simply’ He took up the crayon and was about to draw
      on the flip-chart, but Toad interrupted him.</p>
    <p>‘May I?’ he asked. ‘I know just how to draw it.’ And this is what he
      drew:</p>
    <p><img src="./images/00005.jpg" class="calibre_6" /></p>
    <p>‘Can you tell me more about this Adult State?’ he asked.</p>
    <p>‘The Adult Ego State’, replied Heron, ‘is the rational, unemotional
      way we have of behaving. It enables us to deal with the reality of what
      is happening in the here-and-now.’</p>
    <p>‘And what exactly does that mean?’ asked Toad.</p>
    <p>‘It means’, replied Heron, ‘that it is the state in which we can
      plan, consider, decide and act. It is the state in which we behave
      rationally and logically. When we are in this state, we have all our
      knowledge and skills available for immediate use. We are not driven by
      the old voices of our parents or swamped by the feelings of our
      childhood. Instead, we can consider the present situation and decide
      what we want to do now, based on the facts.’</p>
    <p>‘So does that mean that this Adult State is more important than the
      others?’ asked Toad.</p>
    <p>‘No, not exactly,’ answered Heron. ‘All of the states are essential
      for successful living.</p>
    <p>They have evolved over hundreds of thousands of years and so each
      must be important and have a survival value. But what we <span class="italic">can</span> say is that this Adult
      State
      has a special
      importance.’</p>
    <p>Toad was listening attentively. ‘The Adult Ego State is the only
      state in which we can learn something new about ourselves.’</p>
    <p>There was a long pause. Then Toad said, ‘Are you sure about that,
      Heron? Won’t I learn something when I’m in the Child State?’</p>
    <p>‘No,’ said Heron, ‘I don’t think so. In the Child, you will
      experience the feelings of childhood, both good and bad. You will act
      out those old situations and feel those old feelings. But nothing new
      can be learnt.’</p>
    <p>‘I see,’ said Toad, ‘but what about when I’m in the Parent Ego State?
      Won’t I learn something then?’</p>
    <p>‘Again, I think the answer is “No”, but for different reasons,’ Heron
      replied. ‘When you are in the Parent, you are essentially being either
      critical or nurturing. Either way, you are repeating in words or
      behaviour the beliefs and values you learnt from your parents. You want
      to demonstrate them and tell them to others. It is a state of certainty
      and so there can be no place for new knowledge or ideas. The old ones
      reign supreme. That is why no one ever changes their mind through an
      argument. They simply become more entrenched in their views.’</p>
    <p>Toad paused. ‘So are you saying that I can only learn something about
      myself if I am in the Adult Ego State?’</p>
    <p>‘Yes,’ answered Heron, ‘I believe that is correct. For it is only
      then that you can consider new facts or evaluate your behaviour or, and
      this is extremely difficult, listen to another person’s view of you
      without immediately dismissing it.’</p>
    <p>‘So why have I found it so difficult to learn?’ asked Toad. ‘If what
      you say is true, why didn’t you just get me into my Adult State and tell
      me what to do? It would have saved so much time.’</p>
    <p>‘I don’t know if you are being serious or not,’ Heron replied, ‘but I
      will work on the assumption that you are. First, no one can force
      another person to be in their Adult State.</p>
    <p>You can only encourage them, as I am encouraging you all the time.
      But I can’t force you.</p>
    <p>Only you yourself can decide to behave in that way’ Heron stopped and
      looked intently at Toad.</p>
    <p>‘And second?’ asked Toad quickly, to relieve the pressure he was
      beginning to feel.</p>
    <p>‘Second,’ said Heron, ‘I don’t <span class="italic">know</span> what
      you ought to do. The main aim of this counselling is to enable <span class="italic">you</span> to discover for
      yourself what you ought to do.
      I can facilitate the process, but only you can decide.’</p>
    <p>‘Yes, I recognise that,’ said Toad slowly, ‘but why is it so
      difficult?’</p>
    <p>Heron thought for a while and then said, ‘It is difficult because it
      requires hard work and conscious thought. When you are in the other two
      ego states, it scarcely requires thought to act like a parent or a
      child. We behave unthinkingly because we know what to do and say.</p>
    <p>It’s rather like being in a play’</p>
    <p>‘How do you mean?’ asked Toad, who enjoyed amateur dramatics.</p>
    <p>‘It is as if we take on a favourite role which we know perfectly. We
      know our lines and we know our movements. For instance, take the role of
      Angry Man. The Angry Man knows how to be angry so well. Given the right
      situation (and isn’t it strange how often this occurs for him?) he is
      word-perfect. Without a thought, his voice achieves the right tone and
      level, he automatically selects the appropriate words and his whole
      stance demonstrates his angry feelings. In a word, he plays the Angry
      Man to perfection and, this is the point, without even thinking! It is
      as if his whole life has been a rehearsal for this current
      performance.</p>
    <p>And because he has played it so often, it gets better each time.’</p>
    <p>Toad looked quite anxious. ‘Are you saying that angry people get
      angry deliberately?’ he asked. ‘They choose that role?’</p>
    <p>‘Of course,’ answered Heron, ‘or why else would they do it?’</p>
    <p>Toad paused. ‘Well, it might be that someone has made them angry,’ he
      said.</p>
    <p>‘You’ve made a very important point, Toad, and it’s worth looking at
      it in greater detail. I don’t believe that anyone can <span class="italic">make</span> us feel anything, unless
      they
      use force and
      coercion. In the last analysis, we <span class="italic">choose</span>
      our own feelings. We choose to be angry or we choose to be sad.’</p>
    <p>‘Oh, come on now,’ interrupted Toad. ‘No one in their right mind is
      going to <span class="italic">choose</span> to feel sad or miserable.
      That just doesn’t make any sense.’</p>
    <p>‘I know it sounds unlikely,’ answered Heron, ‘but look at the
      alternative. How could anyone reach into your mind and force you to feel
      anything? Now that really <span class="italic">is</span> impossible.</p>
    <p>They may well influence you or persuade you. But in the end, you
      decide and choose what you will feel.’</p>
    <p>Toad looked perplexed. ‘Are you saying that people choose their own
      mental suffering and torment? I really can’t believe that.’</p>
    <p>‘I agree that it is difficult to accept,’ said Heron.</p>
    <p>‘Bloody impossible, if you ask me,’ muttered Toad under his
      breath.</p>
    <p>Apparently Heron did not hear. ‘Well perhaps “choose” is not quite
      the right word,’ he answered. ‘We don’t choose how we feel in the same
      way that we choose to have another chocolate. But we make these kinds of
      choices unconsciously. It’s more like a conditioned reflex.’</p>
    <p>‘What’s a conditioned reflex?’ asked Toad.</p>
    <p>‘A conditioned reflex is an automatic response to a certain stimulus.
      You must have heard of the famous work of Pavlov, when dogs salivated at
      the sound of a bell which they had learned to associate with being fed.
      The poor beasts became conditioned to doing this.</p>
    <p>They could not stop themselves. It became an automatic reflex.’</p>
    <p>‘I suppose it’s not so different from the doctor hitting your knee
      when your legs are crossed and your foot jumps automatically. You can’t
      stop yourself.’</p>
    <p>‘Exactly,’ said Heron enthusiastically, ‘that’s a perfect example of
      what I mean. Except that we are talking about emotional behaviour.
      Because of our past experiences, we learn to respond to certain
      situations automatically and without thought. You could say that, like
      those dogs, we can’t avoid doing it.’</p>
    <p>‘But that’s just what I’ve been saying,’ intervened Toad. ‘If we
      can’t avoid doing it, it can’t be our fault. You can’t blame me if I get
      depressed. That would be extremely unhelpful.’ He paused. ‘And very
      unfair,’</p>
    <p>‘So, Toad,’ answered Heron after quite a long silence, during which
      Toad felt extremely uncomfortable, ‘who do you blame for your recent
      unhappiness? Who made you feel so bad?’</p>
    <p>Toad stopped and started to think. Something inside warned him that
      he was going down the wrong track, but he was feeling very animated and
      could not or would not stop.</p>
    <p>‘In the first place, it was Badger. And then Rat. And Mole, too, to
      some extent. I told you how horrid they all were to me when I returned
      from…’ he paused, ‘when I returned from being away. And then you have
      helped me to see that it was the way my parents treated me when I was
      growing up that has caused me to be the way I am. I know that they
      probably weren’t aware of what they were doing, but I have to blame
      them. There’s no one else. I <span class="italic">do</span> blame them.
      I have had a rotten life.’ And Toad wept bitter tears of anger. ‘It’s
      not fair,’ he said. ‘It’s just not fair.’ And he went on sobbing.</p>
    <p>Heron sat still. He did not push the box of tissues closer. He just
      sat. Eventually he spoke, and in a way that commanded Toad’s immediate
      attention.</p>
    <p>‘Toad,’ he said, ‘you have come to the cross-roads. You can’t go
      back. So which way will you go?’</p>
    <p>‘I’m not sure what you mean,’ said Toad, drying his eyes. ‘You make
      it sound as if I have to make some sort of choice. Is that right?’</p>
    <p>‘It is,’ answered Heron. ‘The choice is this: how much longer are you
      going to blame other people for your own unhappiness?’</p>
    <p>‘But you know the alternative,’ said Toad petulantly. ‘You want me to
      blame myself.</p>
    <p>And I won’t do it.’</p>
    <p>‘That is not the option I am suggesting at all,’ said Heron. ‘Blaming
      is done from the Child Ego State, which seems to be your favourite
      position. But what might be an appropriate response in your Adult
      State?’</p>
    <p>Toad tried to get his brain to work, but he was full of conflicting
      feelings and subconsciously he knew he was on the edge of a very
      significant piece of self-discovery.</p>
    <p>‘I’m not sure I know,’ he said.</p>
    <p>‘Instead of blaming, how about taking responsibility?’</p>
    <p>There was a long, long silence. ‘I’m not sure I follow you,’ said
      Toad eventually, in a quiet voice. ‘You mean, I should take
      responsibility for my own actions?’</p>
    <p>‘And for your own feelings,’ said Heron. ‘That’s a very adult thing
      to do, and no doubt very difficult. But it does have one enormous
      advantage over blaming others.’</p>
    <p>‘And what’s that?’ asked Toad.</p>
    <p>‘It means that you can start to do something about it. If you take
      responsibility for yourself, you realise that you can take your own
      authority. Consequently, you realise that you have the power to change
      your situation and, more importantly, change yourself.’</p>
    <p>‘But what about my parents?’ Toad asked. ‘What can I do about them?
      How can I get my own back?’</p>
    <p>‘Are they alive now?’</p>
    <p>‘No,’ answered Toad. ‘They have been dead for some time.’</p>
    <p>‘Then there’s only one thing that you can do,’ Heron replied.</p>
    <p>‘And what’s that?’ asked Toad anxiously.</p>
    <p>There was a pause. ‘Forgive them,’ answered Heron.</p>
    <p>Toad started to speak. He wanted to ask Heron why he should forgive
      them. They had made his life miserable. Why shouldn’t he get his own
      back and hurt them in the way they had hurt him? He was beginning to
      feel angry with both Heron and with his parents. They merged in his mind
      into one hated object. He felt that he was on the edge of a terrible
      rage, which if he released it, could do untold damage. It might even
      kill someone. He sat there, his heart beating faster and he felt
      extremely hot. But as always, those strong feelings of anger began to
      evaporate leaving him feeling tired and miserable.</p>
    <p>Whether Heron was aware of Toad’s emotional turbulence is hard to
      say. After a while, he said gently, ‘I think we should finish now,’ and
      walked with Toad to the front door. As they stood on the doorstep, Toad
      turned and said, ‘Heron, are you really interested in me?’</p>
    <p>‘What a strange question to ask!’ answered Heron. ‘I am extremely
      interested in you and I am trying to understand all that has happened to
      bring you to this very moment in time.’</p>
    <p>‘Yes, I know that,’ said Toad, ‘but do you understand all that I have
      been through? Do you understand my life as a whole?’</p>
    <p>‘Well, put like that, I don’t suppose I do,’ answered Heron. ‘I know
      bits of it, especially about your childhood. But I don’t know your story
      from beginning to end. Do you want to tell it to me?’</p>
    <p>‘Yes I do,’ said Toad, ‘very much indeed. I would like to tell you my
      complete story.</p>
    <p>I’ve never told it to anyone before. It’s not that it is so amazing.
      In fact, it’s rather com-monplace, I suppose. I just want the
      opportunity to tell someone everything that has ever happened to me.
      Just once. So that you can understand.’</p>
    <p>‘Very well,’ said Heron. ‘Let’s do that at our meeting next week. You
      shall be the story-teller and narrate “The True History of Toad” to me.
      How about that?’</p>
    <p>‘Thank you,’ said Toad. ‘Goodbye.’ As he walked down the path and
      through the gate, he was already planning what he would say.</p>
    <p><span class="bold">12 </span></p>
    <p><span class="bold">The true history of Theophilus Toad</span></p>
    <p>One week later, Toad was sitting opposite the Heron, waiting to begin
      his narrative. He was feeling quite excited because he realised that
      never again would he have this opportunity to recount his complete
      life-story to an attentive audience.</p>
    <p>‘Where should I begin?’ he asked.</p>
    <p>‘Wherever you like,’ replied Heron.</p>
    <p>‘Well, my earliest memory is sitting on the sand under an umbrella,
      feeling sad. We always went on holiday to Cornwall where we had a large,
      dark house called Moss Terrace.</p>
    <p>You went up steps to get to it and it had a wonderful view over the
      harbour. But it was always an unhappy time. My father only came down at
      the weekends and, as an only child, I was alone with my nanny and my
      mother. Mother was always so busy that I spent a great deal of time on
      my own—feeling sad.’</p>
    <p>‘But what about the rest of your family?’ asked Heron.</p>
    <p>‘If you want me to start right at the beginning, then I have to begin
      with my paternal grandfather, Cornelius. He started the Old Abbey
      Brewery which is brewing to this day.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, it is now owned by the National Beer Company and makes
      lager. Ugh!</p>
    <p>‘He was, I suppose, typical of his generation, hardworking,
      paternalistic to his employees and very moralistic to his family. My
      father told me that in those days, every man received a turkey at
      Christmas and two pints of beer every lunchtime. I remember as a very
      small person being taken around the brewery offices by Grandfather and
      being addressed as</p>
    <p>“Young Master Toad”. I also remember him pointing to me and saying to
      the head clerk,</p>
    <p>“Here’s the future Chairman”, and I felt scared.’</p>
    <p>‘Why was that?’ asked Heron.</p>
    <p>‘Because, even then, I knew that I did not want to work there!’</p>
    <p>‘Why?’</p>
    <p>‘Because I was frightened of Grandfather. He was big physically and I
      could feel that he was very powerful. We lived in a large house in the
      village but he lived at Toad Hall. You can’t imagine what it was like,
      visiting him and Grandmother at the Hall. There were maids and servants
      and cooks and an army of gardeners and once a year at the regatta, the
      house was full of visitors for days at a time. One year, I was told, the
      Prince and Princess arrived by boat and there was a wonderful lunch on
      the lawn. But I’m afraid it’s not half so grand now.’ Toad stopped and a
      large tear rolled down his cheek.</p>
    <p>After a pause, Heron spoke.</p>
    <p>‘What about your father?’ he asked.</p>
    <p>Toad blew his nose and then continued. ‘I always felt that my father
      would have liked to be more like Grandfather than he actually was. So I
      think it made him stricter and more autocratic towards me. When I think
      of him now, and he’s been dead these past twenty years, I can still feel
      his disapproval. I was never the toad he wanted me to be!</p>
    <p>‘Thomas, my father, was hard-working and achieving and driven by the
      Protestant work ethic. I think he always felt the burden of inheriting,
      not only the brewery but also the position of Chief Executive. This was
      especially true when Grandfather retired, but remained Chairman. I am
      sure that Father felt, although he was Managing Director, that he was
      standing in Grandfather’s shadow and he had to prove himself in
      everything he did.’</p>
    <p>‘So how do you remember him?’ asked Heron.</p>
    <p>‘As stern and disapproving. I always wanted his love and attention,
      but I never got it. One of Mother’s recurring phrases was, “Not now,
      Theo,” (my Christian name is Theophilus, although not many people know
      this), “can’t you see that your father is busy?” Father had a way of
      saying, “Theophilus!” that made me quake in my shoes.’</p>
    <p>‘So what about your mother?’ asked Heron.</p>
    <p>‘Fortunately, Mother could be much more loving and I remember some
      cuddles from her. But never in front of Father. When he was present, she
      would be more severe with me and this would make me feel guilty and
      anxious. I never knew what I was supposed to have done to cause her
      sudden change in attitude. But she had quite a sense of fun and I
      remember her playing with me, especially dressing up and singing. Once,
      Father came in unexpectedly and she stopped immediately. To this day, I
      can still experience that same anxiety and guilt for no apparent
      reason.’</p>
    <p>‘And what about her parents?’ asked Heron. ‘Do you remember
      them?’</p>
    <p>‘It’s funny you should ask me that,’ said Toad, with a little more
      animation than he had shown hitherto. ‘Her father, my maternal
      grandfather, had a very strong influence on my early life. He had been a
      Fellow at a college in Cambridge and then became rector in a country
      parish nearby, where he became very involved in the Mission to the South
      Seas.</p>
    <p>Rather to everyone’s surprise, he was made Suffragan Bishop of
      Blewbury and became quite famous for his preaching. I often think that I
      may have inherited a little of his skills of oratory’ As the Heron did
      not respond to this remark, Toad continued.</p>
    <p>‘He was always referred to as “The Bishop” even by Mother, although
      we very rarely saw him, but I remember once that he came to our church
      to preach a missionary sermon.</p>
    <p>Mother strongly supported his work and we had any number of
      missionary boxes in our house, shaped like straw huts, with a slot in
      the roof in which you put your pennies. I was told that the money would
      help the Bishop to start schools and hospitals in the South Seas.</p>
    <p>But more excitingly, the money would also help build a boat to sail
      around the islands.’</p>
    <p>‘But what has this to do with the Bishop’s visit which you remember?’
      asked Heron.</p>
    <p>‘I’m coming to that,’ said Toad. ‘When the Bishop came to preach his
      sermon, he gave us a tour in spirit of the whole boat, as yet unbuilt.
      He asked a blessing on every piston, spar and stanchion and, at the end,
      we sang “For those in peril on the sea”. I was so enthralled that I
      think that was where I got my lifelong love of boats and boating.’</p>
    <p>‘What about your schooling?’ asked the Heron.</p>
    <p>‘That’s another matter,’ answered Toad. ‘When I was seven, I was sent
      to a prep school in Brighton called Galleons where I was deeply and
      continuously unhappy. Luckily the Head was quite a decent sort, gentle
      and slightly shell-shocked from the war. On the whole, we were not
      treated badly, but there was never enough food. But there are two things
      that I can remember to this day.’</p>
    <p>‘What are they?’ asked Heron.</p>
    <p>‘First, the loneliness and sadness of leaving home at the start of
      every term. And second, the excitement of coming home at the end of term
      and then finding it all so disappointing and unwelcoming.</p>
    <p>‘At thirteen, I went to St Endymion’s, a minor public school in
      Yorkshire which was centred both structurally and organisationally
      around the school chapel. The school was founded on the principles of
      muscular Christianity, and this left me out of breath and out of
      sympathy. I never liked it and I found team games agony. There were
      frequent references to “the Bishop, your grandfather” who I discovered
      was on the board of governors. It was made clear to me that he would not
      have been happy with much of my behaviour.’</p>
    <p>‘So was it all pain and grief, Toad?’ enquired the Heron.</p>
    <p>‘Oh no, not at all,’ replied Toad with some vigour. ‘I enjoyed
      singing in the choir, and one of my triumphs was taking the female lead
      in the end-of-term operetta. I started to play golf and got my handicap
      down to twelve. But much more importantly, I discovered that I could
      make friends.</p>
    <p>‘I could always make people laugh and, with Father’s allowance, I
      could also treat them at the tuck shop. I was known as “Good old Toady”
      and I liked that. Come to think of it, I still like it. Perhaps that is
      why I like Mole so much.’</p>
    <p>Toad paused and thought for a minute. The Heron did not interrupt.
      Then Toad continued.</p>
    <p>‘I worked well enough to be able to stay on in the sixth form which,
      in many ways, was where I began to find myself. That was where I first
      began to wear a bow-tie and I can still remember Father’s intense
      disapproval when I wore it at home. For the first time, I felt real
      satisfaction at his reaction. If he was going to disapprove of me, I
      thought at least I would give him something to disapprove of! I’ve worn
      one ever since.’ He fiddled self-consciously with the dark blue
      polka-dotted bow-tie he was wearing.</p>
    <p>‘I also started a dining club at school called “Puddings” and I was
      the founder-president.</p>
    <p>We used to meet out-of-bounds in the neighbouring village, and this
      was the start of my lifelong interest in food and wine. I also started
      to get a reputation as a bit of a bohemian, and bought records of
      Stravinsky and Berg. I think some of the masters were quite impressed,
      but my taste has changed now. I prefer Schubert’</p>
    <p>If these somewhat surprising revelations affected Heron, he did not
      show it, other than by uncrossing and then recrossing his long, thin
      legs. ‘So then what happened?’ he asked.</p>
    <p>‘I went up to Cambridge. Somehow I managed to scrape through the
      Latin entrance exam and got one of the places allocated to my school.
      Initially they wanted me to read theology. Imagine! But this was quickly
      changed to history, which I hated.’</p>
    <p>‘So why did you agree?’ asked the Heron.</p>
    <p>‘Oh, it’s easy enough for you to talk,’ answered Toad peevishly. ‘But
      all my life people have made decisions for me. Can’t you see that?’</p>
    <p>Heron replied that he could not, but would Toad like to continue.</p>
    <p>‘Well, in spite of that, I really enjoyed myself at Cambridge. I met
      up with a crowd of fellows, perhaps not quite the friends my father
      would have wished, and we formed the “Aeolian Poetry Society”. Once a
      week we met in each other’s rooms for breakfast and read out our poems
      and drank white burgundy. As well as this, I was always good at punting
      and in the summer term it was all picnics and hampers up to
      Granchester.’</p>
    <p>‘What about your work?’ asked Heron.</p>
    <p>‘I was just coming to that,’ said Toad, ‘but it’s a bit painful, even
      now.’ He paused and thought deeply. ‘Because of all these other
      activities, my academic work was suffering. To</p>
    <p>be honest, it was really non-existent. I constantly missed tutorials
      and I would send round a charming note of apology to my tutor, together
      with a bottle of vintage port. Nothing was ever said until my final
      term.’</p>
    <p>‘What happened then?’ asked Heron, leaning slightly forward in his
      chair.</p>
    <p>‘Well,’ said Toad, looking very uncomfortable, ‘I have never told
      anyone this before. I was summoned to the Master’s study and he read me
      the riot act. He said some things that were quite hurtful and, to my
      mind, unnecessary. Once again I was compared unfavourably to the Bishop,
      who, it turned out, had been a Fellow at the college.</p>
    <p>‘But perhaps the unkindest cut of all was when the college Chaplain,
      who had actually attended one of our Aeolian breakfasts, sent me a note
      inviting me to ponder on a certain biblical text which I have never
      forgotten.’</p>
    <p>‘What was it?’ asked the Heron, now quite obviously interested.</p>
    <p>‘It was Daniel 5:27. It refers to Belshazzar’s Feast and what the
      Mystical Hand wrote on the wall.’</p>
    <p>‘Well, come on then,’ said Heron, now very interested. ‘What did it
      write?’</p>
    <p>‘It wrote “Mene, Mene, Tekel and Parsin”. I knew this story from
      childhood and we used to say that it meant “Eeney, Meeney, Treacle and
      Parsnips”. But I had forgotten its true meaning.’</p>
    <p>‘Oh, come on, Toad,’ said Heron impatiently. ‘What does it really
      mean?’</p>
    <p>‘It means this,’ said Toad. “‘You have been weighed in the balance
      and found wanting”!’</p>
    <p>There was a long pause, during which Toad fidgeted uncomfortably and
      the Heron looked into the middle distance. Then, when Toad seemed more
      composed, Heron said,</p>
    <p>‘So what happened then?’</p>
    <p>‘The last thing anyone in college wanted to see was an undergraduate
      fail his finals. So I was put on what was called a “Special” course, and
      my final exams consisted of only one paper, “The Life of Nelson”. As I
      had a month to swot for this, I finally passed. My father was so
      surprised and pleased when I told him that I had been awarded a
      “Special” that he increased my allowance! But I knew that dark clouds
      were forming on the horizon and that the storm was about to break.’</p>
    <p>‘Talking of breaks,’ said the Heron, ‘I suggest that we take one
      now,’ and he left the room. Soon after, Toad heard the sound of running
      water and Heron reappeared.</p>
    <p>‘So, where were we?’ asked Heron. ‘Ah yes, I remember. The storm was
      about to break.</p>
    <p>Would you like to carry on, please?’</p>
    <p>‘Well, what I was going to say was this,’ continued Toad. ‘For a long
      time, Father had been dropping hints, not very subtly, that I should
      take over the brewery. The thought appalled me, all that smell and steam
      and having to start work at seven-thirty! I don’t usually get up until
      ten! One minute he was persuading me that it was my duty to do it and
      that the business must remain in the family. This would make me feel
      very miserable and inadequate and I would say that I didn’t feel up to
      it. Then he would round on me, call me a waster and say all manner of
      unpleasant things about me and my friends and how the last thing I was
      capable of doing was managing a business!’</p>
    <p>‘How did all that make you feel?’ enquired Heron.</p>
    <p>‘Well, what do you think? I felt very unhappy and I used to spend a
      lot of time in the local hotel cocktail-bar and get home the worse for
      wear.’</p>
    <p>‘So what happened then?’</p>
    <p>‘A Cambridge chum let me know that they were looking for a junior
      master at my old prep school in Brighton, Galleons. I applied and,
      rather to my surprise, I got the job. I got on well with the boys and I
      was supposed to teach them everything. But the school prided itself on a
      strong naval tradition, so my special knowledge of Nelson proved to be
      invaluable. In fact, I became quite popular and, to be honest, I enjoyed
      it. My nickname was “The Odious Toad”, but I think that it was said
      affectionately’</p>
    <p>‘A man amongst boys and a boy amongst men,’ said the Heron
      quietly.</p>
    <p>‘What was that?’ asked Toad.</p>
    <p>‘Nothing much,’ replied Heron. ‘What happened then?’</p>
    <p>‘Well, I was there for about a year when, out of the blue, I got a
      telegram saying that Father had died from a heart attack and that I was
      to return immediately. Apparently he had just sold the brewery and I
      think that the stress involved in this killed him. Mother, who had a
      whole heap of shares, went off to live with her sister in the West
      Country and I found myself inheriting Toad Hall and a great deal of
      money.’</p>
    <p>‘So you felt happy?’ asked the Heron.</p>
    <p>‘No,’ replied Toad vehemently, ‘I felt very unhappy and very
      inadequate. Toad Hall is a very large place with a banqueting-hall and
      very extensive grounds. I suddenly found that I had to look after all of
      it, which included cooks, servants and outside staff. In the evenings, I
      would walk around the rooms, many of which I had never entered before,
      and feel very alone.</p>
    <p>‘But gradually I began to build up my life. I started to invite a few
      friends in for lunch.</p>
    <p>I hate eating on my own. Then I got very interested in boating and
      made friends with Rat and later with his friend, the Mole. I found that
      other people started to invite me into their organisations. Perhaps it
      was simply that I was now Toad of Toad Hall, but I was invited to become
      the President of the village cricket club and also of the local British
      Legion. I was elected onto the parish council and became a church
      warden, just like my father.</p>
    <p>‘Father had set up the Toad Hall Housing Trust to provide housing for
      local people. I was one of the trustees and all of these activities took
      up quite a few days and evenings every month. Gradually, I found myself
      caught up in a network of civic and social relationships.’</p>
    <p>‘So you felt that your life was becoming a little more purposeful?’
      asked the Heron.</p>
    <p>‘A little,’ replied Toad, ‘but when there wasn’t much happening, the
      old feelings of sadness and isolation would come over me and I would
      have a bad couple of days.’</p>
    <p>‘So how did you react to these feelings?’ asked Heron.</p>
    <p>‘I was always looking for something I could excel at, something that
      would make people look at me and say, “Look at Toad. Isn’t he
      wonderful?” First came boating. I bought some really fine skiffs and
      worked very hard. My ambition, which I have never told anyone before,
      was to enter for the Diamond Sculls at Henley but somehow I never got
      any better.</p>
    <p>Even the ducks used to laugh at me. And then one day I woke up and
      thought, “To hell with boating!”, and I have never rowed again. Until
      the other morning, that is. My boathouse is full of lovely boats that
      are rotting away.</p>
    <p>‘Then came caravanning. I had seen some pictures in a magazine and I
      bought one of the best. It really was beautiful, a brand-new gypsy
      caravan, painted canary yellow, picked out with green and red wheels.
      And it came fully fitted. I can see it in my mind’s eye now.</p>
    <p>Little sleeping-bunks, a little table that folded up against the
      wall, a cooking-stove, lockers, bookshelves, even a bird-cage with a
      bird in it, and pots, pans, jugs and kettles of every size and variety’
      Toad stopped and sat with a faraway look on his face as he remembered
      those golden days.</p>
    <p>‘It so happened that on the day after it was delivered, my friend the
      Rat came round for lunch with Mole and they agreed to come with me on a
      wonderful holiday. Or at least, that’s what I thought it would be!</p>
    <p>‘Oh dear me,’ sighed Toad, tears beginning to roll down his cheeks.
      ‘If only I had known then what I know now. It all seemed so innocent and
      exciting at the time. It was like the world must have been before the
      Fall. We were all little children again. Or at least <span class="italic">I</span> was.</p>
    <p>It seemed that the church clock stood at ten to three and there was
      honey still for tea.’</p>
    <p>He paused. ‘And then everything seemed to go wrong….’ Toad’s voice
      trailed away into silence as he sat there sobbing and remembered how
      evil had entered his world. Heron remained silent.</p>
    <p>Eventually Toad wiped his eyes and sat up straighter. In a small
      voice he said to Heron,</p>
    <p>‘I suppose you know what happened to me after that?’</p>
    <p>‘Yes I do,’ replied Heron. ‘I’ve read about it like everyone else.
      I’m afraid that part of your life is forever in the public domain.’ He
      paused and then said, ‘Shall we stop there? I think that you have given
      me a full and detailed story of your life and I hope you feel that
      because of this, I can understand you better.’</p>
    <p>‘Yes, I do,’ said Toad, who was beginning to cheer up a little. ‘And
      be honest, Heron, it’s quite an interesting story, isn’t it?’</p>
    <p>‘It is extremely interesting,’ answered Heron, ‘but the point is,
      what can you learn from it?’</p>
    <p>And with that question, Heron closed the meeting and escorted Toad to
      the door. As he was about to leave, Heron said, ‘By the way Toad,
      whatever happened to the bird in the cage in your caravan after the
      accident? I’ve often wondered.’</p>
    <p>‘Mole took it home and looked after it,’ Toad replied. ‘As a matter
      of fact, he’s still got it. Nice creature, Mole.’ And Toad walked down
      the path thinking that for most of his life, he had felt as caged as
      that poor bird. Would he ever escape from his past and find freedom?</p>
    <p>He knew how Heron would answer that: he would say, ‘That’s a good
      question, Toad. What is your answer?’ How infuriating! But as he walked
      home, Toad started to work out his response.</p>
    <p><span class="bold">13 </span></p>
    <p><span class="bold">The continuous creation of Toad’s familiar
        world</span></p>
    <p>Being able to tell Heron all about his life in the form of a
      narrative had affected Toad more than he cared to admit. It had been an
      enormous relief to tell another person about his experiences, without
      being laughed at or rejected. Here was his life, for better or for
      worse, in which he was neither a great saint nor a great sinner, just
      Toad. What pleased him most was the way Heron seemed to be genuinely
      interested in all of it.</p>
    <p>As he narrated it, it had given him the opportunity to see his life
      in the round. He began to realise some of the influences which people
      and events had had on him over a long time. He started to see trends in
      his behaviour and the ways in which one experience led to another.
      Previously, when he had recalled past events in his life, they had been
      isolated flashbacks with apparently little connection. Occasionally he
      had recalled and considered longer periods in his life, such as his
      imprisonment, but then he was only too keen to drive away those
      unpleasant thoughts and think about something else.</p>
    <p>But now he was beginning to gain the capacity to recall without
      condemning. He made connections between events and looked at them
      objectively without feeling guilty.</p>
    <p>Gradually, he was beginning to understand why certain things had
      happened in the way they had and to realise the implications. In other
      words, Toad was reflecting on his own behaviour and beginning to learn
      from it.</p>
    <p>He was looking at his life strategically and finding that some of the
      ideas gained from Heron were extremely useful. The idea of life as a
      stage was nothing new, but it was new to think that maybe he had a
      ‘life-script’ which he was acting out whenever possible. It was even
      more disturbing to think that maybe he unconsciously engineered
      situations to enable that script to be regularly used. Did that mean
      that, somewhere in his unconscious (he could use this word now without
      embarrassment), there may even be a ‘life-plot’ with a particular kind
      of ending and towards which unknown forces were driving him?</p>
    <p>If these ideas were true or, as Heron would say, ‘had truth in them’,
      what sort of play was he in? Sometimes it seemed that he was in a comedy
      where he was the object of scornful jeers and laughter, and where, try
      as he might, he could not change the script. But lately he had begun to
      realise that there might be another way of living, where instead of
      following a predetermined script a person might be able to live without
      one, making it up as he went along, so to speak. That could be quite
      frightening, because how would you know what to do or what to say
      without a script? At least this removed the problem of thinking and
      deciding for yourself. Without it, what would you say after you say
      ‘Hello’?</p>
    <p>On the other hand, it could be very exciting to recognise that each
      new moment presents unique possibilities and challenges. Toad decided
      that this was what was meant by being authentic, responding genuinely to
      the demands of the present moment. It could break the chain of cause and
      effect, which might well extend back to childhood, and provide the
      freedom to be who you really are, with the true self emerging unshackled
      from the past. He decided that he would like to be a bit more authentic
      in his life and the way he lived it.</p>
    <p>On the night before the next counselling session, Toad had a
      disturbing dream. He dreamt that he was in an aeroplane, wearing his old
      motoring togs of cap, goggles and gauntlets.</p>
    <p>He was the passenger in the rear open cockpit and the pilot was in
      front. Suddenly, the pilot turned around and grinned horribly at him,
      showing all his teeth. It was Badger. ‘You’re on your own now, Toady,’
      he shouted and, with that, he jumped out and Toad saw his parachute
      open.</p>
    <p>Toad was in great alarm and anxiety because he had never flown a
      plane before, but somehow he managed to land it in a field. He climbed
      out and ran away, just as the plane exploded in a fireball. He woke up,
      covered in perspiration, feeling frightened and yet at the same time
      exhilarated, because he had managed to land the plane himself and escape
      death.</p>
    <p>The next day, Toad went for his counselling session with Heron. After
      the preliminaries, Toad started to tell Heron the thoughts which had
      started to flow from their previous meeting, when he had related his
      life-history.</p>
    <p>‘So you see, Heron,’ said Toad, ‘I have started to think of my life
      much more as a whole and about my script and my own personal drama. But
      what I can’t quite see is, where does it all come from? Is there a way
      of understanding how my script came to be written?</p>
    <p>Because I’m not sure that I like the role I am cast in and, so far, I
      have not enjoyed the play very much. Perhaps if I understood how it
      arose, I could change it. I prefer plays that have a happy ending.’</p>
    <p>Heron smiled. ‘I understand just what you mean, Toad. And it would be
      nice to be in a play which managed to avoid any of “the slings and
      arrows of outrageous fortune”. And we might explore how to cope with
      these sorts of situations later on. But, as I understand it, you would
      like to explore the origins of some of your basic attitudes and
      behaviour. Is that right?’</p>
    <p>‘That’s exactly right,’ replied Toad, ‘but I’m not sure how to
      proceed.’</p>
    <p>‘Well, you won’t be surprised if I tell you that in order to
      understand your present, you must look at your past. In fact, to your
      earliest beginnings. From your birth to about age four or five,
      everything that happened to you made the greatest impression on you and
      your development. It could scarcely be otherwise. This involved how you
      saw yourself and how you saw others. As a result, you have formed your
      particular view of the world and, as far as you are concerned, that’s
      the only way you can see things. You have spent the rest of your life
      living in your world and seeing everything from that viewpoint.’</p>
    <p>Toad thought for a bit and then said, ‘Do you mean that it’s like an
      astronomer taking one particular view of the heavens and basing all his
      ideas and calculations on that one limited and restricted view?’</p>
    <p>‘Exactly,’ said Heron, ‘but we are talking about a psychological view
      of your personal world, taken from deep within you. You might say, a
      view taken from your very soul.’</p>
    <p>‘So what did I see?’ asked Toad.</p>
    <p>‘Each of us sees a different world, depending on the nature of those
      early experiences,’</p>
    <p>answered Heron. ‘And sometimes those worlds are so different, with
      such different beliefs and assumptions, that they can only be reconciled
      by bloodshed in later life.’</p>
    <p>‘I don’t understand that,’ said Toad. ‘Surely we all live on the same
      planet Earth. There can’t be such differences between us, can
      there?’</p>
    <p>‘But you know there can, don’t you, Toad?’ replied Heron. ‘Compare
      your childhood with, let us say, that of a child brought up in the slums
      of Brazil. Or, an even more telling case, an English child, in a family
      much poorer than yours, but who was dearly loved and cherished.’ Toad’s
      eyes glistened with unshed tears.</p>
    <p>‘Each of these children will have formed its own unique and very
      different view of the world. Don’t you see?’</p>
    <p>‘Yes, I understand that,’ said Toad. ‘For instance, if we had all
      taken photographs of one particular day in our childhood, they would be
      very different, wouldn’t they?’</p>
    <p>‘Yes, they would,’ answered Heron. ‘But remember, we are not just
      talking about the physical world. We are talking about your inner,
      psychological world of feelings and emotions which were formed through
      the experiences of those early years. Those first years of life are so
      powerful and vibrant for every child that they result in the formation
      of their unique view of the world. In other words, the world out there
      becomes my world in here,’ said Heron, patting his chest. ‘Whatever
      attitude you formed about life then, will have influenced your behaviour
      and happiness ever since. And it will continue to do so for the rest of
      your life. That is’—and here Heron looked directly at Toad—‘unless you
      decide to change.’</p>
    <p>‘Oh, come on,’ said Toad, ‘surely I’ve not based all my life just on
      those early years?</p>
    <p>I mean, I had hardly begun to live by then and lots of things have
      happened to me since.</p>
    <p>I have had some very exciting and frightening adventures and I know
      they have had a profound effect on me.’</p>
    <p>‘There can be no way round it, I’m afraid,’ said Heron. ‘Every life
      must have a beginning, a middle and an end. And the beginning must
      obviously influence those later stages. As a consequence, you form a
      view of the world based on your initial experiences,’</p>
    <p>‘I’m still not entirely clear about this “view of the world” idea,’
      said Toad. ‘Can you explain it more precisely?’</p>
    <p>‘Yes, I think I can,’ answered Heron. ‘It is as if in your early
      years, say between four and five, you try to answer two questions.’</p>
    <p>‘And what are those?’ asked Toad suspiciously.</p>
    <p>‘The first is “What do I think of myself? Am I OK?” The second is
      “What do I think of others? Are they OK?”’</p>
    <p>There was silence as Toad pondered these existential questions. ‘Who
      asked me those questions?’ he said at last.</p>
    <p>‘Life itself,’ answered Heron, ‘and in particular, your experience of
      it.’</p>
    <p>‘But what exactly does “OK” mean?’ asked Toad.</p>
    <p>“‘OK’ can stand for any specific good and “Not OK” for any specific
      evil.’</p>
    <p>‘So how might I have answered those questions?’ asked Toad. ‘I might
      have said “Yes”</p>
    <p>to one and “No” to the other.’</p>
    <p>‘That’s right,’ answered Heron. ‘And because you can say either yes
      or no, there can be four resulting combinations. Let me write them
      down.’ And he went to the flip-chart, took up the crayon and wrote
      this:</p>
    <p>1 I’m OK; you’re OK</p>
    <p>2 I’m OK; you’re not OK</p>
    <p>3 I’m not OK; you’re OK</p>
    <p>4 I’m not OK; you’re not OK</p>
    <p><img src="./images/00007.jpg" class="calibre_7" /></p>
    <p>‘Do you understand that, Toad?’ Heron asked.</p>
    <p>Toad looked uncertain. ‘I’m not quite with you,’ he said with a
      puzzled look. ‘Can you make it any clearer?’</p>
    <p>‘Perhaps it will help if I draw a diagram,’ said Heron, and he
      proceeded to draw this: Heron continued. ‘On this diagram, you can see
      that the quadrants define these four Life Positions that I have just
      described. What we have to do now is to examine them and tease out their
      meaning.’</p>
    <p>‘But why is this so important?’ asked Toad impatiently, moving around
      in his seat, which was a sure sign that he wanted to challenge what was
      being said. ‘Even if it <span class="italic">is</span> all true, and I
      can’t see how you can possibly know this, what does it matter <span class="italic">now? </span> After all, I may
      have
      taken up one of these
      so-called “positions” when I was three or four but now that I am…’ he
      paused, ‘now that I am older, it seems quite irrelevant’ Interestingly,
      Toad never gave his precise age and Heron never knew it.</p>
    <p>‘My dear Toad,’ said the Heron patiently, ‘the whole point is that
      these are <span class="italic">life</span> positions.</p>
    <p>Once we decide on these attitudes as children, we hold on to them for
      the rest of our lives.</p>
    <p>They become the very fabric of our being. From then on, we construct
      a world which confirms and supports these beliefs and expectations. In
      other words, we make our life a self-fulfilling prophecy.’</p>
    <p>‘Hang on a minute,’ said Toad, ‘you’re losing me again. I thought
      that a prophecy foretold what was going to happen. Like Isaiah and Hosea
      and those other old prophets in the Bible.’</p>
    <p>‘That’s right,’ said Heron. ‘But in this case, <span class="italic">we</span> control events to make sure that
      our
      prophecy
      will come true. We make sure that our world confirms our
      expectations.’</p>
    <p>‘Well, how on earth can we do that?’ asked Toad in some surprise. ‘We
      don’t know what will happen in the future so I can’t see how we can
      influence it. You never know what’s going to happen, even when it seems
      a certainty’ Toad’s experience of attending race meetings over a number
      of years had provided him with proof of this.</p>
    <p>‘I think it would be helpful if I were to introduce a new idea here,’
      said Heron and before Toad could answer, he went to the flip-chart and
      wrote ‘Inevitable Consequences’.</p>
    <p>Toad frowned in concentration. ‘Can you give me an example of what
      you mean by that?’ he asked.</p>
    <p>‘Certainly,’ replied Heron. ‘What are the inevitable consequences of
      drinking too much alcohol?’</p>
    <p>‘Getting drunk, I suppose,’ said Toad who, on occasions, had taken
      one too many.</p>
    <p>‘Anything else?’ asked Heron.</p>
    <p>‘Feeling awful the next day. Having a hangover. Is that what you
      mean?’</p>
    <p>‘Precisely,’ said Heron. ‘These are the inevitable consequences of
      getting drunk. So you could say that it is a way of determining the
      future. If, for instance, you believe that your life is unpleasant and
      unfriendly, getting drunk today is one certain way to confirm this
      miserable expectation tomorrow. In other words, you create a
      self-fulfilling prophecy’</p>
    <p>‘But surely’, said Toad, ‘having a few drinks with friends and then
      having a thick head the next day doesn’t require such a serious
      explanation, does it?’</p>
    <p>‘No, of course not,’ said Heron. ‘What I am describing is behaviour
      which is repeated regularly over a long period. Perhaps over a lifetime.
      This kind of behaviour is then called a game. As a matter of fact, that
      particular game is called “Alcoholic”.’</p>
    <p>‘A game!’ exclaimed Toad. ‘It doesn’t sound much like a game to
      me.’</p>
    <p>‘It’s a psychological game,’ replied Heron. ‘It’s the kind of game
      referred to in that famous book <span class="italic">Games People Play,
      </span> where a hundred games are named and described. And the
      inevitable consequence of playing these kinds of games is that the
      players end up feeling bad and unhappy.’</p>
    <p>‘Could you give me another example of a game?’ asked Toad.</p>
    <p>‘Easily,’ replied Heron, ‘but before we continue, I need you to
      answer this question.</p>
    <p>What is the most important idea that we must examine next?’</p>
    <p>Toad tried to think, but this question had come at him so quickly
      that he was confused.</p>
    <p>‘Just a minute,’ he said. ‘I’m not quite with you.’</p>
    <p>‘Oh, come on, Toad, I haven’t got all day,’ said Heron impatiently.
      ‘It’s obvious what the answer is. Think, man, think!’</p>
    <p>Toad felt that he was back at school being asked a question to which
      he did not know the answer.</p>
    <p>‘Oh you are a duffer, Toad,’ said Heron. ‘Haven’t you been paying any
      attention to what I’ve been saying?’</p>
    <p>Toad mumbled something about not being sure quite what the question
      meant when, suddenly, Heron burst out laughing.</p>
    <p>‘Well, Toad, did you enjoy that game?’</p>
    <p>Toad looked quite sullen. ‘I don’t think it’s fair to ask me that
      kind of question suddenly.</p>
    <p>I didn’t know what to say. You have made me feel quite stupid.’</p>
    <p>‘I’m sorry about that,’ said Heron, ‘but that was the game.’</p>
    <p>‘Was it really?’ enquired Toad, still in a huff. ‘I hope you realise
      that I didn’t enjoy it.</p>
    <p>What was this so-called game called?’</p>
    <p>‘It is called “Guess the Word in My Head”. Teachers have played this
      with their pupils for years and of course they are bound to win. It
      ensures that the student feels stupid, as you did just then, and it
      ensures that the master triumphs over ignorant pupils and feel
      superior.</p>
    <p>I must admit’, added Heron, ‘that I didn’t realise that you would be
      such a strong player.</p>
    <p>But I think I have made my point.’</p>
    <p>‘So you are certainly not talking about “fun and games”, are you?’
      said Toad. ‘That felt quite vicious.’</p>
    <p>‘No, definitely not. Every game is basically dishonest and the
      outcome is always dramatic, rather than merely exciting. What seems on
      the surface to be dealing with factual issues is, in fact, motivated by
      something much more devious. Games are played at two levels. There is
      the social level, where things appear to be open and honest. And there
      is the psychological level, where the motivation is covert. That’s where
      the dishonesty comes in.</p>
    <p>And the inevitable consequences are always negative feelings.’</p>
    <p>There was a long, long silence. Toad felt quite exhausted. At one
      level he was trying to understand these ideas intellectually. But at the
      deeper level of the unconscious, these ideas were touching his very self
      and stirring up an emotional confusion. He wanted to be on his own and
      to let these ideas wash over him and take him where they would. He did
      not know exactly where this would be, but he felt sure it would be in
      the direction of growth.</p>
    <p>Heron saw that Toad was deep in introspection and so he said, ‘I
      think it’s time to finish now,’ and so the session closed. But as Toad
      was on the point of leaving, he turned to Heron and said, ‘I’m feeling a
      bit confused. I know that these ideas about games and life positions are
      very important but I need time to explore them further. I feel that you
      have only skirted around the area and I don’t really understand it
      all.’</p>
    <p>‘You are quite right,’ answered Heron. ‘These ideas are both
      important and difficult and we have only just touched on them. Let us
      use our next session to examine them in greater detail, especially
      psychological games. Shall we do that?’</p>
    <p>‘Thank you,’ Toad replied. ‘That’s just what I would like to do. See
      you next week.’</p>
    <p>And off he went.</p>
    <p><span class="bold">14 </span></p>
    <p><span class="bold">Playing games or winner loses all</span></p>
    <p>‘What will help you most’, said Heron, as he started their next
      session, ‘is to realise the connection between the games people play and
      their life positions. You do remember life positions, don’t you,
      Toad?’</p>
    <p>‘Very clearly,’ said Toad and he went to the flip-chart that was
      hanging on the wall, rifled through the pages and opened it at Heron’s
      diagram of the previous week.</p>
    <p>‘Good,’ said Heron. ‘In that diagram you can clearly see the four
      life positions, with one position represented in each of the quadrants.
      What I propose we do is look at each position in turn and try to
      understand the kind of games people are likely to play. What do you
      think of this approach?’</p>
    <p>‘Yes, that’s fine by me,’ answered Toad. ‘Can I choose which life
      position we start with?’</p>
    <p>‘Of course,’ said Heron. ‘Which one will you choose?’</p>
    <p>Toad turned to a fresh sheet of paper and wrote ‘I’m not OK; you’re
      OK,’. Then he said to Heron, ‘Now what does that really mean?’</p>
    <p>‘It means’, said Heron, ‘that it is the behavioural attitude of
      someone who thinks poorly of himself and feels other people are better
      than he is.’</p>
    <p>‘Better at what?’</p>
    <p>‘Better at almost anything,’ replied Heron. ‘People who have low
      self-esteem usually feel that not only has life dealt them a poor hand,
      but it has also dealt other people a better one. In general terms,
      people in this position feel that they are life’s victims and so they
      play games which result in them being victimised.’</p>
    <p>‘Like what?’ asked Toad.</p>
    <p>‘I’m So Unlucky,’ replied Heron.</p>
    <p>‘Beg pardon?’ said Toad, in some surprise.</p>
    <p>‘That’s the name of the game. It’s played by people who believe that
      they are unlucky and who will readily supply you with a long list of all
      the unlucky things that have happened to them. For instance, some people
      will blame their misfortune on the house they are living in, or even its
      geographical position on supposed leylines and just think of all the
      superstitions that concern bad luck, like breaking a mirror or spilling
      salt.’</p>
    <p>‘But we can be unlucky, can’t we?’ asked Toad. ‘For instance, I’ve
      never won a raffle in my life and I don’t suppose I ever shall.’</p>
    <p>‘I am talking about something much more serious,’ answered Heron.
      ‘I’m talking about people who go out of their way to select and remember
      the sad and unhappy events and forget and discount the good times.’</p>
    <p>‘That seems a very depressing way to lead your life,’ said Toad.</p>
    <p>‘That’s a very observant remark,’ Heron responded, ‘because people
      who play this game <span class="italic">do</span> get depressed. They
      feel that bad forces are affecting their lives which they can’t control,
      and this makes them feel anxious and inadequate.’</p>
    <p>‘What about another game?’ asked Toad, after a pause.</p>
    <p>‘PLOM,’ answered Heron.</p>
    <p>‘Oh, I remember that one,’ Toad said quickly. ‘It means Poor Little
      Old Me and at one of our sessions you accused me of playing it!’</p>
    <p>‘Yes, I did mention it before, but I don’t think I accused you of
      playing it,’ Heron said.</p>
    <p>‘My aim is not to accuse you but to help you recognise the games you
      are playing so that you can give them up.’</p>
    <p>‘Do you really think I play this game?’ Toad asked.</p>
    <p>‘Well, what do <span class="italic">you</span> think?’ responded
      Heron. ‘Certainly at the start of our sessions, you were suffering from
      an acute attack of self-pity, wouldn’t you say?’</p>
    <p>‘Yes, you’re quite right. I did feel that everyone was picking on me,
      especially when I first returned home after my adventures. I certainly
      felt very depressed and inadequate then. I’ve always wanted people to
      love me, no matter what I do.’</p>
    <p>‘Now that’s another game,’ said Heron.</p>
    <p>‘What is?’</p>
    <p>‘Love Me No Matter What I Do. Some people make messes or get into
      scrapes just to see how far they can go before someone stops forgiving
      them or rejects them. “There you are,” they can say. “That proves that I
      really am that bad or that stupid.”’</p>
    <p>‘These games seem very dangerous to me,’ said Toad. ‘Because if
      someone you love or respect gives up on you, you certainly would feel
      miserable and all on your own.’</p>
    <p>‘I agree,’ said Heron. ‘You are beginning to realise how dangerous
      these games can be—that they can seriously damage your health.’ There
      was a pause as they both sat quietly in deep thought. After a while,
      Heron asked, ‘Toad, what do you think is the most extreme behaviour that
      a person who feels “Not OK” can take?’</p>
    <p>Toad said in a quiet voice, ‘Suicide, I suppose?’</p>
    <p>‘Yes,’ said Heron. ‘Now of course, I’m not saying that everyone who
      feels “Not OK” is going to kill himself. But did you know that suicide
      is one of the major causes of death in young men in England?’</p>
    <p>‘No, I didn’t know that,’ Toad replied, ‘but I can believe it. I have
      been in that situation and it is very desolate. And frightening.’ He sat
      quietly as he remembered how close he had once come to the abyss. After
      a while, Heron spoke.</p>
    <p>‘What Ego State do you think people are in when they play these
      victim games?’</p>
    <p>‘Sad Child, I should think,’ replied Toad. Then with more vigour he
      said, ‘No, I shall be more positive. It’s definitely the Sad Child
      State. I can speak from experience. I know.’</p>
    <p>And again he was silent.</p>
    <p>‘Shall we look at another of the Life Positions?’ asked Heron after a
      while, and he wrote</p>
    <p>‘I’m OK; you’re not OK’. ‘Do you understand what this position means,
      Toad?’</p>
    <p>‘I think so,’ said Toad. ‘It must describe someone who thinks that he
      or she is better than other people. So I suppose they will play games to
      reinforce this. Is that right?’</p>
    <p>‘Yes, it certainly is,’ answered Heron. These are usually games where
      the player can be angry, or at least critical or judgemental. People in
      this psychological position often get into positions of power and
      authority and then they can play their game.’ He wrote on the flip-sheet
      ‘NIGYYSOB’.</p>
    <p>‘What on earth is that?’ asked Toad.</p>
    <p>‘It is the initial letters of the name of the game. They stand for
      “Now I’ve Got You, You Son of a Bitch”.’</p>
    <p>‘That’s an ugly-sounding game,’ said Toad, who could be quite
      fastidious about the proper use of English.</p>
    <p>‘Yes,’ answered Heron. ‘And it’s an ugly game to play’</p>
    <p>‘So what happens?’ Toad asked.</p>
    <p>‘Well,’ said Heron, ‘this game is frequently played at work. First of
      all, someone makes a mistake which, as you can imagine, often happens.
      The boss then notices it, calls in the erring subordinate and proceeds
      to give him or her a dressing down, shouting and raving at them out of
      all proportion to the offence committed. As you can see, this game
      allows the angry person to get angry, apparently justifiably, thus
      confirming the “I’m OK; you’re not OK” Life Position. They have the
      proof that other people are essentially incompetent and unreliable, and
      second, that it is their duty to chastise and punish them. “Otherwise”,
      they say, “they will think they can get away with it!”’</p>
    <p>‘Phew,’ exclaimed Toad. ‘I can sympathise with anyone who has been on
      the receiving end of that game. It reminds me all too clearly of my
      father when I was little. And not so little. I can see now that NIGYYSOB
      was one of his favourite games.’</p>
    <p>‘Unfortunately, this game seems to be on the increase, especially in
      organisations,’</p>
    <p>replied the Heron. ‘It’s all too easy for people in authority to act
      out their phantasy of the punishing parent and treat their staff like
      naughty children. The papers seem to be full of cases of bullying. In
      your case of course, you had no one to whom you could appeal.</p>
    <p>‘There are other games played from the “I’m OK; you’re not OK”
      position which you may recognise,’ continued the Heron. ‘Such as “Why Do
      You Always Let Me Down?”’</p>
    <p>‘Good heavens,’ said Toad. ‘That’s Father again. He was always saying
      that’</p>
    <p>‘Or playing it,’ Heron interjected.</p>
    <p>‘Yes,’ answered Toad. ‘He played it regularly with me. It always
      worked. I ended up feeling useless or guilty and he, I suppose, was
      confirmed in his belief that I was useless and that he was a superior
      being. Do you think that’s right, Heron?’</p>
    <p>‘I’m afraid so,’ Heron replied. ‘It will have confirmed his feelings
      of moral superiority and it is often associated with another game, “How
      Dare You!”’</p>
    <p>‘It seems as if people in this Life Position always need to attack
      and condemn,’ said Toad.</p>
    <p>‘You have got it exactly,’ said Heron. ‘These are the persecutors who
      use any opportunity to create situations where they can judge and punish
      others. It is interesting to wonder just what are their own internal
      persecutors that lead to this behaviour.’ After a pause he asked,</p>
    <p>‘What do you think is the most extreme behaviour that a person who
      feels “I’m OK; you’re not OK” can take?’</p>
    <p>Toad paused for a moment and then said, ‘Murder, I suppose.’</p>
    <p>‘Yes,’ replied Heron. ‘Fortunately, few people go that far. But you
      will hear people say about a boss at work, “It’s murder working for
      him!” And they mean it.’</p>
    <p>‘So presumably people in this position play games from the Parent
      State?’ mused Toad.</p>
    <p>‘And always from their Critical Parent,’ added Heron. ‘These people
      are quick to criticise, anxious to get angry and want to judge others by
      impossible standards. Of course, sometimes they may make a pretence of
      being in their Nurturing Parent, when they say things like, “This hurts
      me more than it hurts you” or, “I’m doing this for your own good”, but
      most of us can recognise hypocrisy when we hear it. But there is another
      interesting thing about people in this psychological position,’
      continued Heron. ‘They rarely, if ever, get depressed.’</p>
    <p>‘Why is that?’ asked Toad in some surprise.</p>
    <p>‘Because anger is such a good defence against depressing thoughts,’
      answered Heron.</p>
    <p>‘Angry people never feel guilty, because they always blame others.
      They defend themselves by projecting their internal fears outwards on to
      others, so they can be angry with them instead of with themselves.’ Toad
      looked puzzled, so Heron said, ‘Let me give you an illustration of what
      I mean. Suppose that someone in the “I’m OK; you’re not OK” position has
      ordered a taxi which fails to arrive. When this happens, how will he
      feel?’</p>
    <p>‘He will probably feel very angry,’ Toad answered. ‘I can imagine
      Badger getting in quite a rage and playing NIGYYSOB with the taxi firm
      over the phone.’</p>
    <p>‘Exactly,’ said Heron. ‘But now imagine a similar situation, only
      this time the person is in the “I’m not OK; you’re OK” position. How
      will <span class="italic">he</span> feel?’</p>
    <p>Toad considered this new situation and didn’t like what he saw. ‘He
      won’t get angry,’ he answered, ‘that’s for sure. But after that, I don’t
      know what he would do.’</p>
    <p>Heron then said, ‘Imagine it is you, Toad, in that situation. There
      you are waiting for a taxi which hasn’t arrived. How will you feel?’</p>
    <p>Toad thought for a while and then said, ‘I suppose I will start to
      feel sad and wonder why the driver has forgotten me. I might think that
      he has many other important calls and that I’m at the bottom of the
      list’ Then after a pause he said, ‘I might even blame myself and think
      that maybe I hadn’t made the arrangements properly’</p>
    <p>‘So you can see the difference?’</p>
    <p>‘Yes, of course I can,’ replied Toad with some vehemence. ‘And what
      implication am I supposed to draw from that? That I should get angry
      like Badger and tell people what I think of them and shout and rave? Is
      that what you think I should do?’ He paused and then he looked directly
      at Heron and said, ‘I suppose you think that I am “Not OK” and that I am
      a complete wimp. Is that it?’</p>
    <p>‘No, not at all,’ answered Heron. ‘These ideas are not to be used as
      labels with which to attack or insult people. They are simply ways of
      trying to understand behaviour, especially our own.’</p>
    <p>‘You sound quite defensive,’ said Toad. ‘And I am not attacking you.
      But I have to say that, at this minute, I am feeling quite angry with
      you. I’ve felt it boiling up for some time and now I want to let it
      out.’ Heron tried not to look surprised, but he was. ‘You always seem to
      be getting me to admit my faults and failures,’ Toad continued, ‘and yet
      you never tell me directly what you think of me. All this time, you say
      “What do <span class="italic">you</span> think, Toad?</p>
    <p>How do <span class="italic">you</span> feel, Toad?” You never tell me
      what you think of me, and yet you’re supposed to be the qualified
      counsellor, whatever that means. And sometimes you seem just like my
      father. Well, I think I’ve had enough!’ He sat in his chair and
      confronted Heron directly.</p>
    <p>There was complete silence. Finally, Heron said, ‘So what are you
      going to do about it?’</p>
    <p>Toad almost exploded. ‘There you go again. More questions. Let me
      tell you, I’ve had just about enough of your bloody questions.’ He
      looked at Heron, as if daring him to speak.</p>
    <p>He could feel his heart beating strongly, but it wasn’t pounding. He
      realised that, although he was genuinely angry, he was in complete
      control of himself. He was also aware, without fully understanding it
      all, that he had just done something of great significance which somehow
      involved both Heron and his father.</p>
    <p>If he were to be honest, a part of him felt frightened at what he had
      just done. He had not just been rude to Heron. He had taken him on and
      in some way, overthrown him, and somehow this had also involved his
      father. Suddenly he felt that he no longer needed to play the
      subservient role. He could assert himself and say what he wanted to say.
      Although he realised that he would have to deal with the new situation
      that this would inevitably cause. For instance, how would he deal with
      Heron now?</p>
    <p>‘I’m sorry about that,’ he said eventually. ‘But I am not
      apologising. I have been wanting to say that to you for some time, and
      that seemed to be the right time. Do you understand?’</p>
    <p>‘I think so,’ answered Heron. ‘Do you want absolution?’</p>
    <p>‘No I don’t,’ said Toad. ‘I stand by what I said. But I suppose
      that’s the end of our counselling?’</p>
    <p>‘I think it is,’ said Heron. ‘But on reflection, I would like us to
      have one more session.’</p>
    <p>‘Why is that?’ asked Toad. ‘I really feel that our work is finished
      now.’</p>
    <p>‘Finished, yes, but not completed,’ Heron replied. ‘There are two
      reasons why I think we should meet for a final session. The first is
      that I would like you to have the opportunity to review what you have
      learnt here and what you intend to do about it. In other words, what
      changes you intend to make.’</p>
    <p>‘Yes, I can agree to that,’ said Toad. ‘And the second reason?’</p>
    <p>‘The second reason is that I think we should work together in this
      new relationship which seems to be forming between us now and try to
      understand what has happened.’</p>
    <p>‘I agree,’ said Toad. Then he added, ‘Thank you, Heron,’ and they
      shook hands in a serious sort of way.</p>
    <p><span class="bold">15 </span></p>
    <p><span class="bold">The final session</span></p>
    <p>When Toad returned to the Hall, the first thing he did was to look at
      his diary. For a long time now this had been practically empty, except
      for his regular appointments with Heron.</p>
    <p>But recently his social life had begun to improve and there was an
      increasing number of entries.</p>
    <p>When he had been in his depressed state and for some time before Mole
      had found him, Toad had experienced the most horrible ennui. Time seemed
      to stretch before him like a desert with no goals or signposts and each
      day brought only emptiness, robbing his life of purpose. He had forced
      himself to put some structure into his existence by going for a daily
      walk, and the counselling sessions had provided at least something to do
      between one formless week and the next.</p>
    <p>Gradually, things had started to change as he began to feel better.
      It was as if the development in his inner world was reflected in his
      growing social life. For instance, in the previous week he had attended
      the AGM of the Bankside Cricket Club, where he was re-elected President
      unopposed. Everyone came and greeted him and said how pleased they were
      to see him looking so much better. To his surprise and pleasure, he was
      presented with a new club tie, in the tasteful colours of lime green,
      mauve and chocolate. He was cheered as he removed his bow-tie there and
      then and replaced it with the new one, and all of this gave him very
      warm feelings. He also realised that, with the coming season, Saturdays
      would be taken up with cricket, and he entered these in the diary. His
      desert of loneliness was starting to bloom again.</p>
    <p>Looking through his diary, Toad also saw with pleasurable
      anticipation another entry, which was for lunch at the Red Lion Hotel in
      a few weeks’ time. He had only yesterday received this invitation from
      the Rat, to what was described as a ‘Celebration Lunch’.</p>
    <p>Because he wasn’t sure what was being celebrated, he had telephoned
      Rat and asked him.</p>
    <p>To Toad’s great surprise, Rat had answered, ‘Your recovery, of
      course, and we shall all be there!’</p>
    <p>But perhaps the diary entries which gave the strongest evidence of
      Toad’s changed attitude were those which referred to ‘My New Venture’.
      Previously, work and Toad had always seemed incompatible, due mainly to
      his early fears of having to work for his father in the brewery. But as
      he reflected on his work with Heron, Toad realised that his continued
      development and improvement required purpose, and purpose required work.
      For too long, his wealth had cushioned him from the need for employment
      and his inner strength and resources had become soft and flabby, like an
      athlete who had stopped training. But now he was feeling altogether
      different. What he wanted to do now was to compete—and to win!</p>
    <p>Carefully and gradually Toad was making plans for his future. This
      had resulted in meetings with two of his past acquaintances, both of
      whom were now working in the City.</p>
    <p>He had also held meetings with the family bankers and for the first
      time looked closely at the accounts and understood the parlous state of
      Toad Hall and its estates. All this spurred him on to think about what
      he really wanted to do, and gradually an idea began forming in his mind:
      he wanted to start his own business!</p>
    <p>He was not at all worried when, to his surprise, Heron telephoned to
      postpone their next meeting. He apologised and suggested another date in
      three weeks’ time. This in fact had suited Toad well, as he had already
      arranged some more meetings concerning his new venture and needed the
      extra time. Finally they agreed to meet on the morning of Toad’s lunch
      with his friends, and as he entered this new appointment in his diary,
      he ringed both events to indicate their importance to him.</p>
    <p>When that day dawned, Toad woke early and lay awake in bed, thinking
      about what might happen at his final session with Heron. He was a little
      apprehensive about the meeting and, if he only knew, so was Heron. When
      they had last met three weeks ago, it had resulted in a curious
      situation which neither of them fully understood. Toad knew he had got
      angry with Heron and yet he knew that he had not lost his temper. Heron
      knew that Toad had fought him in some significant way and yet he had not
      been rebellious. Somehow, this event had been productive and full of
      meaning and had changed their relationship. But neither was sure what
      would happen next.</p>
    <p>After breakfast, and seeing that it was a lovely morning, Toad
      decided to cycle, and he was soon spinning along the lanes that took him
      to the Heronry. Propping his machine against the wall, he rang the bell
      for the last time and waited for Heron to open the door.</p>
    <p>They greeted each other formally and sat down in their usual
      places.</p>
    <p>‘Well, Toad,’ said Heron, ‘so this is to be our last meeting.’</p>
    <p>‘Yes it is,’ answered Toad. ‘It will seem strange not to come here
      again.’</p>
    <p>‘Do you know how many meetings we have had?’ Heron asked.</p>
    <p>‘As a matter of fact, I do,’ Toad said. ‘I was going through my
      diary. Discounting that first and rather disastrous meeting, we have had
      ten sessions. It seems like more.’</p>
    <p>‘Does it?’ asked Heron. ‘It certainly seems a long time ago since you
      first came here and I asked you how you were feeling. Do you remember
      what you said then?’</p>
    <p>‘I remember very well,’ replied Toad. ‘I cried and rated myself one
      or two on your feelings scale.’</p>
    <p>‘Well, you are certainly looking brighter now,’ said Heron. ‘At that
      first meeting, you looked very sad and despondent. But now you are
      looking alert and happy.’ Toad was certainly looking well. There was
      more colour to his cheeks and his large eyes were clear and bright. He
      was wearing a check suit which he had recently bought and this was
      complemented by his new cricket-club tie.</p>
    <p>‘So how are you feeling now?’ Heron asked.</p>
    <p>‘I was wondering when you would get around to asking me that,’ said
      Toad smiling.</p>
    <p>‘I am certainly feeling much better in myself. My appetite has
      returned and I am sleeping normally. You know, at one time I was
      sleeping very badly and waking up so early. Why was that?’</p>
    <p>‘It’s hard to say precisely but it is one of the recognised symptoms
      of people who feel depressed,’ Heron said. ‘I expect it was connected
      with your inner fears. When you are feeling like that, anxious thoughts
      come into your conscious mind and prevent you from relaxing. It is as if
      they sound alarm bells inside you to tell you that all is not well—in
      the hope that you might do something about it.’</p>
    <p>Toad thought about that for some time and then said, ‘You are
      probably right. But I also have a lot more energy now. Not just
      physical, but mental. At one time I couldn’t seem to get interested in
      anything, it all seemed too much effort. You know, I could hardly read
      the newspaper. But that’s all different now. I’ve started to make plans
      for the future. I don’t mean just good intentions, like New Year’s
      resolutions, but real plans involving details and dates for action,’</p>
    <p>‘Good,’ said Heron, ‘so how is all this making you feel right
      now?’</p>
    <p>‘Well, I know that this might sound banal,’ Toad replied, ‘but I am
      feeling happy. I actually look forward to each day as full of exciting,
      new possibilities, whereas not so long ago, everything seemed so
      pointless. That’s a real change, isn’t it?’</p>
    <p>‘It certainly is,’ Heron replied. ‘So where are you now on the
      Feelings Thermometer?’</p>
    <p>Toad replied immediately. Today I would put myself at nine. It could
      almost be ten, but I want to reserve that for later, in case things
      improve even more.’</p>
    <p>‘So how do you feel about other people?’ asked Heron.</p>
    <p>‘It’s funny you should ask me that,’ Toad answered. ‘I don’t know
      why, but when we first met, I had lost interest in my friends and what
      they were doing. In fact, they almost seemed to have become my
      persecutors. But I certainly don’t feel like that any longer. Now I’m
      really interested in what they are all doing and’, he added, ‘I hope
      they are interested in me.’ He told Heron about the lunch he would
      attend after this session and what he intended to reveal.</p>
    <p>‘So, no more suicidal thoughts?’ asked Heron matter-of-factly.</p>
    <p>‘No, none at all,’ Toad replied. ‘I feel that I can now take life
      much more as it comes.</p>
    <p>But I shan’t forget how low I felt. The memory of it will always be
      there, perhaps as a kind of reminder of what life is like at the
      boundaries,’ He sat looking solemn.</p>
    <p>After a little while, Heron asked, ‘So how would you describe
      yourself now?’ Toad got up and went to the flip-chart and opened it at
      the page which showed the Life Positions.</p>
    <p>‘Could I be in the “I’m OK; you’re OK position”?’ he asked. ‘It feels
      almost like tempting fate, but that’s how I feel,’</p>
    <p>‘That’s bravely chosen,’ said Heron.</p>
    <p>‘Why do you say “brave”?’ asked Toad. ‘That is really how I
      feel.’</p>
    <p>‘It’s brave’, replied Heron, ‘because in selecting that position you
      not only make a choice, you also make a commitment. For life.’</p>
    <p>‘What exactly do you mean?’ asked Toad, looking puzzled.</p>
    <p>‘I mean that being in the “I’m OK; you’re OK” position is a dynamic,
      not a static state. You can’t get there and say, “That’s it. I’ve
      arrived”, as if you have just conquered Everest. Being OK, and believing
      that others are, requires behaviour and attitudes which continuously
      demonstrate this, both to yourself and others. And it is certainly not a
      shelter from the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune.’</p>
    <p>‘I see,’ said Toad. ‘You mean that to say “I’m OK; you’re OK“is
      really an act of faith?’</p>
    <p>‘Yes, I do,’ answered Heron. ‘It is very near to being the Humanist’s
      credo, a belief in oneself and others which does not require a belief in
      a god or the supernatural.’</p>
    <p>‘You make it sound very solemn,’ said Toad.</p>
    <p>‘If by “solemn” you mean full of importance,’ Heron replied, ‘then I
      don’t disagree.’</p>
    <p>There was silence, then Toad said, ‘Our relationship has changed,
      don’t you think, Heron? There was a time not so long ago when, if you
      had said that to me, I would have felt that you were putting me down
      because I had said something stupid. But now I can think about it and
      see if I agree with you or not. That’s certainly a change, isn’t
      it?’</p>
    <p>‘It is,’ said Heron. ‘And do you think that this change in our
      relationship has come about because of me or because of you?’</p>
    <p>‘I know what the right answer to that is,’ said Toad with a smile.
      ‘I’m sure that you want me to say that it is due to the changes in me.
      And, to a great extent, I agree. I know that I have changed. I don’t
      feel so dependent on you and I can challenge you without feeling that
      I’ll get a reprimand.’ He paused and then added, ‘But I have to say that
      I think you have changed as well.’</p>
    <p>‘In what way?’ asked Heron.</p>
    <p>‘You don’t seem so dogmatic or critical. At one time I used to look
      to you for the slightest sign of your approval or disapproval. Although
      I have to admit that you usually looked impassive and hid your
      feelings.’</p>
    <p>After a pause, Heron said, ‘So from what you have just been saying,
      how would you describe our relationship during the sessions?’</p>
    <p>‘I don’t know if you meant it to be so,’ answered Toad, ‘but a lot of
      the time I felt that it was a parent-child relationship. I frequently
      felt dependent on you and I was always hoping that you would give me
      some wise words which would provide the answer.’</p>
    <p>‘And did I?’ asked Heron.</p>
    <p>‘No, not really,’ Toad replied. ‘You have certainly taught me a lot
      and this has been very helpful, but you never gave me answers. What I
      now realise is that you were always trying to get me to answer my own
      questions, getting me into the Adult.’ He paused and then added, ‘But
      now, quite recently, we appear to have a much more relaxed
      relationship.</p>
    <p>Especially since last session. That seems to have been a milestone in
      my development,’</p>
    <p>‘It’s interesting that you should say that,’ Heron replied, ‘because
      I was thinking that during our work together you have gone through what
      I can only describe as the process of growing up psychologically’</p>
    <p>‘In what way?’ asked Toad.</p>
    <p>‘I mean’, answered Heron, ‘that when you first came here you were in
      a state of dependency, like a child, just as you have described. You
      were expecting to receive answers and you were constantly looking to me
      for signs of parental approval. Of course, I tried not to do this and I
      kept throwing the ball back to you by asking, “What do you think?”
      and</p>
    <p>“How do you feel?” And that made you angry’</p>
    <p>‘It certainly did!’ Toad answered with some feeling. ‘I used to feel
      so annoyed with you.</p>
    <p>And you know how my anger finally boiled over and what happened at
      our last meeting.’</p>
    <p>‘I do,’ said Heron. ‘And I can see now that it was a very important
      step in your development. You behaved like a teenager standing up to his
      parent. You faced up to me as the pendulum of your feelings had swung
      from dependency to feeling angry and a wanting to reject me. In fact,
      you were being counter-dependent.’</p>
    <p>‘I was?’ asked Toad. ‘So why should that event seem so significant to
      me now?’</p>
    <p>‘Because’, answered Heron, ‘you transferred feelings which you had
      towards your father on to me. In dealing with me, you at last dealt with
      him. You actually found the strength and courage to act like a man and
      not like a child. In doing that, you grew up and moved into adulthood
      and as you asserted your own authority, you acted independently’</p>
    <p>‘I see,’ said Toad after a while. ‘So you think that in our work
      together, I have moved from being dependent to feeling counter-dependent
      and then finally to being independent.</p>
    <p>Is that right?’</p>
    <p>‘Yes I think it is,’ Heron replied. ‘In counselling, we work not only
      with our brains but with our feelings. Whilst you can begin to
      understand behaviour intellectually, you can only fully understand
      yourself through getting in touch with your own emotions. As these
      become clearer to you, you realise that your feelings are not optional
      extras that can be ignored, but they are the very centre of your
      self.’</p>
    <p>‘I see,’ said Toad again thoughtfully. ‘So when I got angry with you
      last time, are you saying that I changed as a result of that, because my
      feelings were genuinely engaged?’</p>
    <p>‘Yes I am,’ said Heron. ‘You did emotional work and you learnt
      directly through the event. Whenever our emotions are genuinely engaged,
      there is the opportunity for growth.</p>
    <p>This is true experiential learning, which is how we have learnt
      anything of importance, right from birth.’</p>
    <p>‘That sounds rather anti-intellectual, learning through our
      emotions,’ said Toad. ‘What about all our schools and universities?
      Aren’t they all dedicated to helping people learn through their
      intellect rather than through their emotions? Don’t we need to be able
      to solve problems and keep our emotions out of things?’</p>
    <p>‘That’s perfectly true,’ Heron replied. ‘People know how to do this
      and work hard to improve their technical excellence. At this moment, for
      instance, more and more managers are dealing with bigger and bigger
      technical problems than ever before. There are more people in education
      than at any previous time. Our colleges and business schools are
      chock-a-block. The world of intelligence and IQ is thriving. We have
      never before known so much about our physical world….’ Here Heron paused
      and then asked quietly, ‘But what about the world of EQ, emotional
      intelligence? Just how much do we know about that?’</p>
    <p>‘I remember you mentioned this once before,’ said Toad, ‘but I didn’t
      understand it then.</p>
    <p>What does EQ really mean?’</p>
    <p>‘It means’, said Heron, ‘understanding your own inner emotional life
      and being able to control it. And you can see that this is totally
      different from IQ.’</p>
    <p>‘So what’s someone like who has a high EQ?’ asked Toad.</p>
    <p>‘In a nutshell,’ replied Heron, ‘they have great self-awareness and
      know their own emotions. They can manage their own feelings and bounce
      back from sadness and misfortune.</p>
    <p>But perhaps most importantly, they can control their impulsiveness
      and delay gratification, so avoiding hasty and ill-considered decisions
      and actions.’</p>
    <p>‘Hm,’ said Toad, ‘I’m learning up to the last minute. So far I have
      never been very good at delaying gratification. And that got me into all
      sorts of trouble. But I hope I have become a little more emotionally
      intelligent since working with you.’ He paused and then said, ‘Is there
      any more about EQ?’</p>
    <p>‘Yes there is,’ replied Heron. ‘It concerns understanding other
      people. Someone with a high EQ can recognise how someone else is
      feeling. You know that this skill is called “empathy”. But perhaps the
      greatest skill that results from emotional intelligence is the ability
      to form good relationships with others, through understanding and
      handling their emotions. And that leads me on to make my final point
      before we finish,’ Toad was sitting stock-still and paying the greatest
      attention to all that Heron was saying.</p>
    <p>‘Emotional intelligence allows you to go further in the direction of
      your own growth and development because with it you can move on from
      being independent to being interdependent,’</p>
    <p>‘What does that mean exactly?’ asked Toad.</p>
    <p>‘Independency’, replied Heron, ‘implies a sort of pride in being
      yourself, with all your unique talents and differences, and a readiness
      to defend this new-found autonomy, like a nation gaining its freedom
      from a colonial past. And there is nothing wrong with that. But being
      interdependent suggests a maturity and self-acceptance, together with an
      acceptance of others in spite of their differences. Being interdependent
      allows you to relate effectively with others and cooperate with them,
      both socially and at work.’</p>
    <p>‘Yes, I can see that but—’</p>
    <p>Toad was never to finish his sentence for the Heron suddenly
      interrupted him. ‘Toad, just look at the time! We are fifteen minutes
      late. I’m so sorry. I’ve been going on rather, I’m afraid.</p>
    <p>I do apologise because I know you have another engagement immediately
      after this.’</p>
    <p>‘That’s alright,’ said Toad. ‘I’ve really enjoyed this session and it
      won’t matter if I’m a bit late for lunch.’ They both got up from their
      seats and walked down the hallway, where Toad collected his overcoat
      from the hallstand and put it on.</p>
    <p>‘Oh, Heron,’ he said, ‘I almost forgot.’ And he reached into his
      pocket and took out a package wrapped in brown paper. ‘This is for you.
      It’s a small “thank you” present.’</p>
    <p>‘That’s very kind of you,’ said Heron. ‘Shall I open it now?’</p>
    <p>‘Yes, go ahead,’ answered Toad. ‘It’s only a little thing.’ Heron
      opened the package to reveal a small, beautifully turned wooden bowl,
      with the light and dark grains highly polished.</p>
    <p>‘I made it myself from a walnut tree which blew down at the Hall,’
      Toad continued.</p>
    <p>‘I’ve always liked woodturning and I thought you might like this as a
      little reminder of our work together.’</p>
    <p>‘Thank you very much,’ said Heron. ‘I shall always treasure this. It
      will remind me of all the things I have learnt from our work
      together.’</p>
    <p>‘Really?’ asked Toad in some surprise, ‘I didn’t know that <span class="italic">you</span> were supposed to learn
      anything. I thought it
      was only me.’</p>
    <p>‘Well, you’re quite wrong there,’ Heron replied. ‘In counselling,
      learning is always a two-way process, although we each learn different
      things. But off you go now Toad, else you will be late for your lunch.
      Goodbye,’</p>
    <p>‘Goodbye Heron,’ said Toad. ‘And thank you,’ And he got on his
      bicycle and rode off in the direction of the Red Lion, never to see
      Heron again.</p>
    <p><span class="bold">16 </span></p>
    <p><span class="bold">Farewells and new beginnings</span></p>
    <p>It was Rat who decided that Toad’s recovery should be marked by a
      lunch. ‘It’s too easy’, he said, ‘to let significant events pass by
      without notice or celebration. Perhaps this is because we usually only
      recognise their importance after the event.’</p>
    <p>For reasons best known to himself, Rat chose to hold this event in
      the Red Lion, an old coaching inn with a central courtyard and
      wood-panelled dining-rooms. The waiters seemed as old as the building,
      with drooping moustaches and long, white aprons which reached down to
      their cracked black shoes.</p>
    <p>Even before Rat entered, he knew what the menu would be: Brown
      Windsor soup, roast Norfolk turkey with chipolatas, followed by sherry
      trifle, some dry cheddar, coffee extra.</p>
    <p>He arrived first in order to check that the private room he had
      booked was properly laid up.</p>
    <p>Rather to his surprise, the appearance of the room (called the Isis
      Room) was excellent, the table laid with a gleaming white starched cloth
      and napkins, sparkling glasses and heavy, old-fashioned cutlery.</p>
    <p>He studied the wine list and, as he expected, saw several wines of
      good vintage and reasonably priced. He ordered a couple of bottles of
      claret and then repaired to the bar to await the arrival of the others.
      He ordered a pint of his favourite beer, ‘OBJ’, which stood,
      appropriately, for ‘Oh Be Joyful!’ and, in a spirit of great
      contentment, leaned on the bar and quaffed his ale.</p>
    <p>The next to arrive was Toad. He was feeling relaxed and at ease and
      was looking forward to meeting his friends and telling them all that had
      happened. But as he walked casually through the courtyard, having leant
      his bicycle against the hotel railings and straightened his new
      cricket-club tie, his legs turned to water. For he recognised exactly
      where he was and the events associated with the place flooded over him.
      For this was <span class="italic">the</span> Red Lion, the very inn
      where, having escaped from his reforming friends years ago, he had eaten
      an enormous lunch and then (oh horror! he could scarcely continue) he
      had stolen a beautiful motorcar and driven straight to prison.</p>
    <p>Luckily, at that moment Rat appeared at the hotel doorway and in his
      sensitive way he said, ‘Hello Toady, you look as if you’ve just seen a
      ghost. You’re the first to arrive. Come on in and I’ll buy you a drink.’
      Regaining his composure somewhat, Toad followed Rat into the bar. The
      oldest waiter gave him a long and enquiring look, but Toad was able to
      stare back and handed him his coat to hang up.</p>
    <p>‘What’ll you have then?’ asked Rat. ‘A pint of bitter?’</p>
    <p>‘Certainly not,’ replied Toad. ‘You know I always have a brandy and
      soda.’</p>
    <p>‘Nonsense, Toad,’ replied Rat with some spirit, ‘I can remember many
      times when you’ve had a beer.’</p>
    <p>‘Name one,’ said Toad, practising his new-found assertiveness.</p>
    <p>Fortunately, before the discussion could become too heated, Mole and
      Badger arrived together. They had shared a cab and Badger, as usual, had
      managed to get Mole to pay.</p>
    <p>‘Hello, Badger. Hello, Mole.’</p>
    <p>Soon they were all standing in a group at the bar and talking
      animatedly.</p>
    <p>‘Good idea of yours, this lunch, Ratty,’ said the Badger in his
      kindly way. ‘Well done.’</p>
    <p>Rat half thought he might have his head patted. Toad was telling Mole
      one of his tall stories and Mole was saying ‘Really’ and ‘Then what
      happened?’, but in fact he had heard it before and was thinking about
      lunch.</p>
    <p>At that point, the old waiter came in and said to Rat, ‘Lunch is
      ready now, sir, if you would like to go in.’ So in they trooped and were
      soon eating their soup and tucking into their turkey, helped down with
      liberal glasses of the excellent claret which Rat had chosen.</p>
    <p>Then there was the sherry trifle, which actually had some sherry in
      it.</p>
    <p>‘That’s unusual,’ said Badger. ‘Usually the chef merely waves the
      cork over it.’</p>
    <p>Toad and Mole both had seconds and then cheese and coffee were
      served, by which time everyone was feeling mellow and contented. Toad
      was about to take out a very large cigar from his cigar-case, when a
      stern look from Badger made him replace the offending weed, patting his
      pocket as if he were merely looking for his handkerchief.</p>
    <p>‘Well,’ said Badger, smiling affably at all of them, ‘so what are you
      all planning to do now?’ There was silence. Small animals do not usually
      do much forward planning.</p>
    <p>Regularity and rhythm, within the framework of the changing seasons,
      provide the comfort that keeps anxious thoughts at bay. To change
      involves risk, and risk could bring danger, and danger means
      threats.</p>
    <p>But after all they had been through and learnt about themselves,
      change had already happened to them and they knew they had to move on,
      whatever the risk. They were all growing up and learning how to put away
      childish things. So it was inevitable that each of them had made plans,
      even though, so far, they had not shared them with each other.</p>
    <p>‘Shall I start then?’ asked the ever-helpful Mole. There was a chorus
      of agreement, and so Mole continued, ‘I’m going back to Mole End. I’m
      going to turn it into a restaurant.’</p>
    <p>The Rat, who had no knowledge of this, blurted out, ‘But you can’t
      cook for toffee. You can’t even boil an egg!’</p>
    <p>‘Go and boil your head,’ said Mole under his breath, but in a louder
      voice, ‘I shan’t be doing the cooking. I’ve got a very good chef. Do you
      remember Otter’s young cub, Portly, who once got lost but we found him?
      Well, he’s quite grown up now and seems to have been touched by the
      gods. He can cook the most delicious fish dishes, and his desserts are a
      delight. His speciality is bread and butter pudding. We are going to
      open it soon and it will be called “The Garibaldi”.’</p>
    <p>‘I remember now,’ said the Rat. ‘I only visited your house once, but
      it was a very snug and compact place, and you had a bust of Garibaldi in
      your garden.’</p>
    <p>Mole smiled with pleasure. ‘You remembered, Ratty. I’m so pleased.
      And do you remember the rest of the garden—the goldfish pond with the
      cockle-shell border and the silvered glass ball that reflects everything
      all wrong? Well, that is where the restaurant will be. Otter is putting
      up the money and will be my partner. But I shall manage it and Portly
      will be the chef.’</p>
    <p>‘Well done, Mole,’ said Badger. ‘I shall come and patronise you
      frequently. I like my grub, I do.’ Badger could be remarkably vulgar
      when he chose.</p>
    <p>‘I’ll be there too,’ said Toad. ‘What a ripping idea. When will you
      open?’</p>
    <p>‘Probably in the autumn,’ replied Mole. ‘You know, when most animals
      are fairly quiet and beginning to slow down and will appreciate the
      particular ambience of Mole End.’</p>
    <p>‘I know exactly what you mean,’ said Badger, who welcomed the
      undergroundness of Mole’s house.</p>
    <p>Mole continued, ‘And then, in the spring, we shall do picnic-hampers.
      You know, cold tongue cold ham cold beef-pickled gherkins salad
      frenchrollscress sandwiches potted-meat ginger beer lemonade soda water,
      that sort of thing.’</p>
    <p>I wonder where he got that idea from? thought Rat, remembering their
      very first picnic together on the river, but said nothing.</p>
    <p>Mole stopped. He realised that, until recently, he would have been
      much more shy and reticent in speaking. Now he was the centre of
      attention and was describing his plans clearly and interestingly. He
      felt stronger and happier than he had done for a long time.</p>
    <p>He leaned over to the Rat and said quietly, ‘You will come, won’t
      you, Ratty?’</p>
    <p>‘Of course, Moley. I shall be your most regular customer.’ Ratty
      smiled his twinkly smile and they both knew they would stay firm
      friends, in spite of Mole returning home.</p>
    <p>‘Well, how about you then, Ratty?’ Toad asked. ‘What will <span class="italic">you</span> do now that you will be
      all
      on your own?’</p>
    <p>Rat swallowed hard. He had known for some time that this would be an
      awkward moment, but it had to be faced. Looking into the middle
      distance, rather than directly at any of his friends, he said, ‘I am
      leaving the river bank!’</p>
    <p>‘You’re going to do what?’ asked the Badger in his severest
      tones.</p>
    <p>‘I am going to leave the river bank. In fact, I am going to move to a
      grey, seaside town in the South. It’s a lovely little place with a
      harbour which has one steep side with tall stone houses and gardens
      running down to the rocks.’ Rat’s voice had become stronger and his eyes
      glistened as he visualised the place he was describing. ‘When you look
      down the flights of stone steps, overhung with great pink tufts of
      valerian, you see patches of sparkling blue water. The harbour is full
      of little boats tethered to the rings and stanchions of the old sea
      wall. And all the time a small ferry boat keeps chugging from one side
      of the harbour to the other, taking people to work and bringing them
      home again.</p>
    <p>‘When you walk out of the town, there is a pretty beach where you can
      shrimp and where they serve cream teas on trays and you can eat sitting
      on the rocks. In the spring, all the woods and pathways that wend their
      way along the cliff-top are carpeted with primroses and violets, and you
      can climb up and look out to see ships from all over the world sailing
      in and out of the harbour, their sails billowing white like the clouds
      above them.’ Ratty stopped. His friends knew that he liked to write
      poetry, but this was the first time they had heard him speak like this.
      They were entranced.</p>
    <p>‘But’, Toad said gently, ‘won’t you be lonely without us?’</p>
    <p>‘No, not exactly,’ answered the Rat. ‘You see, I shall be renewing
      the acquaintance of an old friend of mine. He was a seafaring rat from
      Istanbul. I hadn’t seen him for ages, but recently he wrote to me from
      that seaside town in the South, offering me a job. He owns a small
      bookshop called “Wayfarers All” which specialises in travel and he wants
      me to manage it. Apparently it’s just opposite the parish church and it
      only takes a minute to walk down to the town quay. I shall live above
      the shop and although it will be very different from my beloved river
      bank, I mean to make a go of it’</p>
    <p>‘Well, Ratty,’ said the Mole, ‘you have surprised me, you really
      have. But as you were talking, I remembered how, long ago, you became
      obsessed with “going south”, as you called it and I almost had to fight
      you to make you see sense. Are you sure this isn’t just another attack
      of southern fever?’</p>
    <p>Rat smiled. ‘No Mole, this is quite different. It is true that those
      memories have lingered and, in fact, that was when I first met
      Alessandro, my sea-going friend. But since then I have carefully
      considered what I want to do and what differences this change will make
      to my life. You will always be a close friend, Mole, but I must move on.
      And besides,’ said the Rat quietly, ‘I am going to write a book.’</p>
    <p>‘About what?’ asked Toad.</p>
    <p>‘Perhaps about you, Toady. And you, Badger, and you, Moley and about
      all the adventures we have had. For no matter what happens, those
      memories are so vivid that I can run them like a film through my
      head.’</p>
    <p>‘What will you call it?’ asked Mole.</p>
    <p>‘I’m not too sure at the moment. Perhaps “The Breeze in the
      Bushes”.’</p>
    <p>‘Not much of a title, that’, said Badger disparagingly. ‘You need
      something more gripping to gain the public’s attention. How about “Boats
      and Badgers”? That sounds much more exciting.’</p>
    <p>‘We shall see,’ said Rat. ‘As I said, I am still undecided, but if I
      can write the book, I know I can find the title.’ He had known it would
      be difficult to break the news of his departure to his friends and when
      he had started to speak he had felt extremely anxious. But once he got
      going, he knew what he wanted to say and he knew he had said it well. In
      fact, he had practised in front of the bedroom mirror until he felt
      confident, even deciding when to speak softer and when to pause for
      dramatic effect. And he had been effective. But not too effective,
      thought Rat. I don’t want them down all the time visiting me for a
      holiday.</p>
    <p>The waiter brought more coffee and a dish of petit fours and everyone
      helped himself.</p>
    <p>Toad and Mole began to quiz Rat about his plans, which left Badger
      sitting rather impatiently and looking pointedly at his pocket
      watch.</p>
    <p>‘So I expect you all are wondering what <span class="italic">I’m</span> going to do?’ he asked.</p>
    <p>‘Yes of course we are,’ said Toad warmly. ‘You know we are. It’s just
      that Mole’s and Rat’s plans are so surprising and exciting.’</p>
    <p>‘And you don’t think mine will be, is that it?’ Badger asked
      aggressively.</p>
    <p>‘No, of course it’s not that,’ said Rat. ‘Tell us your plans.’ And
      stop acting like a baby, thought Mole, at the same time looking at
      Badger with polite interest.</p>
    <p>‘Well, all right,’ said Badger, somewhat mollified. ‘But you all need
      to pay attention, like Mole here, because I have some very important
      news.’ The others composed themselves, feeling that they had just had a
      ‘wigging’ from the headmaster.</p>
    <p>‘As you all know, for a number of years I have given a great deal of
      my time to local affairs and I have been proud to represent the many
      simple and mainly honest folk who live in the Wild Wood. There are many
      important issues which have to be dealt with, like keeping out the
      developers who want to build horrid bungalows on the edge of the wood
      and which would increasingly encroach on where we live. Or stopping them
      building a road through a part of the wood, for your wretched
      poop-poops, Toad.’</p>
    <p>Toad was about to protest and say that that was a long time ago and
      nowadays he bicycled everywhere, but Badger’s stern looks and loud voice
      made him keep quiet and look suitably apologetic. But as Badger went on,
      Toad knew that what he was saying was true. Badger was a patrician and,
      not surprisingly, many of the smaller animals in the Wild Wood looked to
      him for a lead in local issues and felt safe under his protection.</p>
    <p>Badger had got elected on to the Parish Council and then on to the
      Wild Wood Rural District Council and had worked hard to protect the wood
      and its inhabitants. In another age he would have been a ‘green’, but
      for Badger it just seemed natural to preserve the habitat where they all
      lived and on which they depended for their sustenance and life
      itself.</p>
    <p>‘My philosophy has always been’, Badger continued, his half-moon
      glasses on the end of his nose giving him an air of wisdom and
      authority, ‘that there should be One Nation and, therefore, One Wood. We
      need to integrate people, not split them apart and drive them into
      factions. Those of us who have been blessed with this world’s goods have
      a responsibility towards the deserving poor and I like to think that I
      have contributed towards this by setting up our local Woodlands
      Hospital, of which I have the great honour to be Chairman.’ He paused,
      waiting for the round of applause, but none came.</p>
    <p>Well I’m blowed, thought Mole. He’s a blessed Tory and it’s as if
      he’s giving us his election manifesto. I’m not having that. Does he
      think I’m one of his deserving poor? I’ll show him! But Badger moved on,
      allowing no room for interruptions.</p>
    <p>‘Individual freedom, with a proper concern for the less fortunate,
      can only exist within the framework of the law. Those who break the law
      must be punished, and punished severely if the crime warrants it.’</p>
    <p>At these words, Toad had gone pale and was fingering his tie as if it
      were preventing his breathing. The memories of his appearance in court
      before the magistrate and his subsequent incarceration could still come
      back and give him the horrors.</p>
    <p>‘I say, Badger,’ said Rat, ‘steady on! Remember who’s here.’</p>
    <p>Badger stopped instantly. Although he could be pompous and bossy, he
      could also be warm and caring. ‘I say, Toad. I didn’t mean you. I just
      wasn’t thinking. Careless of me.</p>
    <p>Please forgive me.’</p>
    <p>‘All right,’ said Toad, ‘but I am still very sensitive about that
      issue.’</p>
    <p>‘Of course you are,’ replied Badger. ‘I have always believed that if
      someone pays their debt to society, as you have, Toad, then they should
      be fully rehabilitated and integrated into society’ At these kind and
      generous words, Toad felt much better and poured himself another
      coffee.</p>
    <p>‘So when I was appointed Chairman of the local bench’, Badger
      continued, ‘it seemed to me that my different activities combined to
      form a lifetime, if I may say so, of service to my fellow
      creatures,’</p>
    <p>Mole knew that Badger was proud of his achievements and not at all
      reticent about his activities and appointments. In fact, the brass plate
      by Badger’s dark green door, just below the iron bell-pull which Mole so
      clearly remembered from one of his most terrifying adventures, had
      recently been replaced. The new plate, neatly engraved in square capital
      letters, now read ‘MR BADGER, JP’.</p>
    <p>‘Well,’ said Toad, who by this time was growing slightly impatient,
      ‘you mean that you are going to carry on doing the same things you are
      doing now.’ Badger gave him a very stern look. ‘Not that there’s
      anything wrong with that,’ Toad added hastily. ‘Life of service,
      commitment to the community, that sort of thing. Very important.’</p>
    <p>Mole started to giggle, but a sharp kick from Rat on an old wound on
      his shin made him stop.</p>
    <p>‘If you would only listen, Toad, you would hear the really important
      news that I am going to impart’ They all waited expectantly and Badger,
      looking extremely important, said, ‘I have been asked to stand as the
      Parliamentary Candidate at the next election!’ For a moment, everyone
      was silent. Then they found their voices and came up to Badger and shook
      his paw and clapped him on the back and congratulated him and Badger
      enjoyed every minute of it.</p>
    <p>‘I can just imagine you as our MP,’ said Rat. ‘You could always make
      a good speech, you are as straight as a die and you have a genuine
      concern for everyone on the river bank and in the Wild Wood.’</p>
    <p>In spite of his differing political views, Mole knew a good animal
      when he saw one and, before he knew it, he was shouting, ‘Three cheers
      for Badger. Hip-hip hooray. Hip-hip hooray. Hip-hip HOORAY!’</p>
    <p>Badger was genuinely moved by this spontaneous show of affection and
      regard and wiped his eyes on the red cotton handkerchief he always
      carried. There was much talking as everyone told everyone else what a
      good MP Badger would make and how they were not at all surprised by the
      news and Badger was saying how he would welcome help with addressing
      envelopes and that sort of thing. Gradually the talking trailed off into
      silence and Toad found that his three friends were looking at him with
      an air of expectation.</p>
    <p>‘Well, come on Toad,’ said Mole. ‘We’re all waiting to hear <span class="italic">your</span> plans. I’m sure they
      will be absolutely
      wonderful.’</p>
    <p>Poor Toad! He had been rather dreading this moment, for it reminded
      him of another time when he had had the opportunity to amaze his friends
      with his scintillating wit and song, and then had thought better of it.
      That was some years ago now, at the banquet he had given to celebrate
      the reoccupation of Toad Hall. Then, as now, he would have liked to take
      the stage and amaze and delight his friends with his great oratory, or
      perhaps a stirring song sung in his pleasing tenor voice.</p>
    <p>But he knew now that this would be inappropriate and not express what
      he really wanted to say. Toad the Great Entertainer, Master of a
      Thousand Disguises, Terror of the Roads, was a fantasy and a dangerous
      one at that. Whenever he had adopted one of these roles, it always ended
      in tears, or worse. At that previous banquet he had behaved in a modest
      and unselfish manner only because he feared the wrath and displeasure of
      Badger, whom he had seen as a severe and critical parent.</p>
    <p>Now he chose consciously not to play the fool and remembered from his
      Sunday-school days the story of Polycarp. A venerable and scarcely
      remembered saint, Polycarp was about to be martyred when he heard a
      voice saying, ‘Be strong, Polycarp, and play the man!’ So Toad said to
      himself, ‘Be strong now and play the Toad!’</p>
    <p>‘Well, look, you fellows,’ he said quietly yet firmly, ‘I certainly
      have made some plans which will have a great effect on my life. Although
      you may think them dull. You see, I’ve taken a job,’</p>
    <p>‘What?’ said Badger in utter amazement, ‘you mean you are going to
      undertake paid and gainful employment?’</p>
    <p>‘Yes I am,’ replied Toad, looking Badger unflinchingly in the eye.
      ‘In fact, I have already started.’ Rat fidgeted in his chair. Trust old
      Toady to amaze us, he thought.</p>
    <p>‘But what is it?’ Rat asked. ‘What exactly are you going to do?’</p>
    <p>‘I am going into estate management. As you all know, I have spent a
      lot of my time managing the Hall. It’s not been all caravanning and
      driving fast cars, you know.’ Here Toad tried to look severely at Mole,
      but he could not keep it up. He started to grin and then he laughed with
      Mole and then all the others joined in. (That’s nice, he thought. For
      the first time that I can remember, they are laughing <span class="italic">with</span> me, not <span
        class="italic">at</span>
      me.)</p>
    <p>‘No, but seriously, you chaps, there is a lot of work to do on the
      estate, seeing the Hall Farm is properly managed, cutting and planting
      timber, that sort of thing. So I’ve got together with a couple of others
      and, using the money which Father left me, we are going to set up our
      own estate and property business. Because of my particular experience, I
      shall be looking after the better end of the market, such as Riverside
      Residences and Country Estates (the snob end more like, thought
      Mole).</p>
    <p>‘I have to tell you, Toad,’ said Badger, ‘that I am both pleased and
      delighted. I know that your father would be equally pleased and not a
      little surprised. Well done, Toad.’ These words were music to Toad’s
      ear.</p>
    <p>‘What will your company be called?’ asked the practical Rat.</p>
    <p>‘We shall be called “Knight, Toad and Frankly”, and we are setting up
      our offices in London. We are currently negotiating for premises in the
      Strand,’</p>
    <p>‘Did you say London?’ asked Mole in rather an anxious voice. ‘Isn’t
      that in the Wide World, to which I thought we never went or even
      referred?’</p>
    <p>‘Tosh!’ said Toad spiritedly. ‘There’s a great deal of nonsense
      talked about the Wide World. Of course, when you are small and have only
      lived in a restricted community, it can appear big and threatening. But
      after a bit you can find your own place in it and play a much bigger
      role. I believe I can gain more autonomy there and there are certainly
      more opportunities to be had.’</p>
    <p>(Well, he may be right, thought Mole, but I’m glad I’m not moving. I
      know the river bank and it knows me. And if that’s a restricted
      community, then I’m all for it.)</p>
    <p>‘So will you be staying at the Hall?’ asked Rat.</p>
    <p>‘No. I’ve sold it’</p>
    <p>There was a stunned silence at this news. Badger was horrified.
      ‘You’ve done what? You’ve sold Toad Hall? You know what they will do
      with it, don’t you? They will turn it into an hotel or, God forbid, a
      safari park with foreign animals which have no right to be here.’</p>
    <p>‘Calm yourself, Badger,’ said Toad, controlling the situation most
      ably. ‘I have sold it to a group of businessmen who are going to turn it
      into a Management College. We have agreed that the main building will
      stay untouched….’</p>
    <p>‘It has to,’ interrupted Badger. ‘It’s a listed building.’</p>
    <p>‘Although no doubt they will need to build a bedroom block and other
      facilities,’ continued Toad, quite calmly. ‘To tell you the truth, it’s
      a burden off my shoulders. The Hall was getting increasingly expensive
      to maintain. The West Wing needs re-roofing and the kitchen needs to be
      completely refurbished.’</p>
    <p>‘So where will you live?’ asked Mole.</p>
    <p>‘I have bought a house in the village, the Old Rectory. I’m sure you
      know it. It’s quite a nice late Victorian house, with a manageable
      garden and lovely views across the valley.</p>
    <p>And it means that I can easily walk to the station and catch my train
      to the City’</p>
    <p>‘Presumably travelling first class and not on the footplate,’ said
      Rat rather pointedly.</p>
    <p>Toad was about to be quite angry but instead he laughed and said,
      ‘Yes, Ratty, I shall be travelling quite legitimately and not pretending
      I’m a washer-woman.’</p>
    <p>‘Toad,’ said Mole, ‘you never cease to amaze me! Since the first time
      I met you, many years ago, I have always found you exciting and larger
      than life. I know you have got into all sorts of scrapes but at least
      you have lived an exciting life. Compared to me, I feel you have drunk
      life’s experience to the last drop. So won’t you find your new life
      rather dull, just being “something in the City”?’</p>
    <p>‘Mole, you really are the most perceptive creature! You have spoken
      the thoughts that at one time I dared hardly admit to my consciousness.
      There certainly has been a lot of excitement in my life: stealing cars,
      escaping from prison, being a master of disguise, outwitting the police.
      Oh yes, I’ve had some excitement, that’s for sure.’ Here Toad’s voice
      was starting to rise and he began to puff himself up. But he quickly
      realised what was happening and resumed a calmer disposition. He coughed
      and then continued, ‘I have decided to join the local Amateur Operatic
      Society. That way I can have fun playing a role on stage, rather than
      getting it mixed up in real life. And without conceit and after a
      thorough audition, I have been given the lead in their next
      production,’</p>
    <p>‘Well done, Toady. Good old Toady,’ his friends chorused, showing
      their genuine pleasure. ‘What’s the part?’</p>
    <p>‘I am to be the Pirate Toad. I wear a hat with the skull and
      crossbones on it, a striped jersey and an eye-patch.’</p>
    <p>‘Sing us one of the numbers, oh please do,’ asked Mole,
      imploringly.</p>
    <p>‘Yes, come on Toad,’ said Badger. ‘This is one of my favourite comic
      operas.’</p>
    <p>‘Very well,’ said Toad, ‘but you must join in the chorus.’ He waited
      for silence and then he started. His voice was clear and melodious and
      he was able to strike just the right note of mock-heroics. After each
      verse the others joined in the chorus, which consisted of these
      words:</p>
    <p><span class="italic">Toad</span></p>
    <p>For I am the Pirate Toad</p>
    <p><span class="italic">All</span></p>
    <p>Hurrah for the Pirate Toad</p>
    <p><span class="italic">Toad and all</span></p>
    <p>And it is, it is a wonderful thing To be a pirate Toad.</p>
    <p>By this time, all the friends were laughing and singing, and Toad was
      getting into the spirit of things and was in danger of singing the whole
      of the first act, when there was a knock on the door. The old waiter
      came in and said apologetically, ‘I am sorry, gentlemen, but have you
      finished? We have to clear away and prepare the room for another event
      this evening.’</p>
    <p>Rat looked at his watch and was amazed to see that it was almost six
      o’clock. Coats were fetched, goodbyes said, and everyone went out into
      the cool, clear evening.</p>
    <p>The taxi, which had been waiting for some considerable time in the
      yard, drove up to the front entrance and Mole and Badger got in. The
      driver was about to give them a piece of his mind for being kept waiting
      but, when he saw that it was Badger, he decided otherwise and wished him
      a good evening. They drove off, with Mole waving out of the window. Rat
      sauntered off down the road, swinging his cane, thinking about summer at
      the seaside and imagining what kind of a boat he might buy to sail in
      the harbour when he moved south.</p>
    <p>Toad put on his bicycle clips, pulled out a flat cap from his
      overcoat pocket, adjusted it to the correct angle, mounted his machine
      and pedalled off towards the Hall. His head was full of what he was
      going to do, and he was feeling in a very good frame of mind. He
      recalled how his friends had reacted to the news that he was starting
      his own business and especially what Badger had said to him. He’s not
      such a bad old stick, he thought, I think I dealt with him rather well.
      And he found himself humming a tune he had not thought of for ages. As
      he remembered it more clearly, he began to sing the words softly to
      himself with great enjoyment.</p>
    <p>‘The world has held great heroes,</p>
    <p>As history books have showed.</p>
    <p>But never a name to go down to fame,</p>
    <p>Compared to that of Toad!’</p>
    <p>He laughed with delight when had sung this. ‘Well,’ he said, ‘it’s
      only a bit of fun. And actually, it’s not a bad poem.’ And so he decided
      to sing the remaining verses. Only this time, because there was no one
      about, he sang them at the top of his voice, only finishing as he cycled
      up the drive of Toad Hall, breathless but happy.</p>
    <p>‘The clever men at Oxford</p>
    <p>Know all that there is to be knowed.</p>
    <p>But they none of them know one half as much</p>
    <p>As intelligent Mr Toad!</p>
    <p>The animals sat in the Ark and cried,</p>
    <p>Their tears in torrents flowed.</p>
    <p>Who was it said, “There’s land ahead”?</p>
    <p>Encouraging Mr Toad!</p>
    <p>The army all saluted</p>
    <p>As they marched along the road.</p>
    <p>Was it the King? Or Kitchener?</p>
    <p>No. It was Mr Toad!</p>
    <p>The Queen and her Ladies-in-waiting</p>
    <p>Sat at the window and sewed.</p>
    <p>She cried, “Look! Who’s that <span class="italic">handsome</span>
      man?”</p>
    <p>They answered, “Mr Toad”.’</p>
